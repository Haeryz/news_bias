Fox News,"Biden Education Dept asked to pause student loan plan until safeguards in place to prevent fraud, abuse","Student loan forgiveness for borrowers is great, but President Biden's plan does not address the ever-rising cost of a college education, Americans in D.C. say. The Defense of Freedom Institute (DFI) wrote a letter to U.S.Department of EducationInspector General Sandra Bruce Wednesday asking for an immediate ""pause"" to student loan cancellation applications until necessary precautions are implemented to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. ""DFI writes because we are deeply concerned that the Biden administration’s recently announced student loan debt cancellation policy lacks basic safeguards against waste, fraud, and abuse,"" the letter reads. ""Some of these safeguards could be easily implemented—such as directing borrowers to give the Department permission to confirm income through Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records during the application process,"" it added. The DFI criticized the Education Department's current measure allowing for ""self-certifications"" to verify eligibility for thecancellation program, noting the potential for waste to come from the allotted $430 billion cost. FIRST LAWSUIT FILED TO BLOCK BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT The U.S. Department of Education building in Washington, D.C.(STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) ""This is simply unacceptable, particularly where, as here, no statutory requirement or other deadline exists that requires the Department to act with such haste,"" the organization added in the letter. ""Accordingly, we urge your prompt action to request that the Department immediately pause its processing of student loan cancellation applications until the agency has established a system of rigorous safeguards to protect the interests of the taxpayer."" BIDEN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT TO COST MORE THAN $400 BILLION: CBO In a press release issued Wednesday, the nonprofit slammed the existing measures by calling out the Education Department's own acknowledgment of the application process' shortcomings, writing, ""by ED’s own admission, its system for approving loan cancellation applications relies largely on fraud-prone self-certification of income eligibility.""

""This is the sort of malfeasance that happens when an administration acts without authorization from Congress and makes it up as it stumbles along. This behavior simply cannot stand, and that’s why we are calling on the IG to urge the Department to immediately stop processing student loan cancellation applications until rigorous safeguards are put in place to protect billions of dollars in taxpayer money.""

SEN. DURBIN SAYS HIS SON WAS A VICTIM OF PPP FRAUD, CALLS FOR MORE OVERSIGHT OF FEDERAL COVID-19 FUNDS DFI also relayed its critique of the ""self-certification"" process toCOVID-19 relief aid, pointing to red flags highlighted by several Inspectors General at the time the aid was announced. ""The Inspectors General of several federal agencies, including the Department of Labor and the Small Business Administration, raised alarms about the risks of self-certification within weeks of the first wave of COVID disbursements.

Fox News,Biden calls SC primary 'real comeback' as he sets sights on Super Tuesday,"2020 presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden looks ahead to Super Tuesday with Chris Wallace. Former Vice PresidentJoe Bidencalled his victory in Saturday night’sSouth Carolina Democratic primary“a real comeback” as he looks to carry momentum into the upcoming Super Tuesday primaries. Biden, who appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” seemed confident that the South Carolina win shows he can challenge his Democratic presidential primary rivalBernie Sandersand reclaim the mantle as his party’s front-runner in the race to battlePresident Trumpin November’s general election. “It’s a big boost,” Biden said. “I think it starts the real comeback and we picked up a lot of delegates.” BIDEN TOUTS VICTORY IN SC PRIAMRY, SNIPES AT SANDERS' REVOLUTION Biden, however, hedged his victory in the first in the South primary by noting that the race is far from determined. “We have a long, long way to go. This is a marathon,” he said. After poor fourth- and fifth-place finishes in Iowa’s Caucuses and New Hampshire’s primary, followed by a distant second-place showing last weekend in Nevada’s Caucuses behind Sanders, Biden had staked his campaign’s future on South Carolina. In the Palmetto State, where Biden was counting on his popularity among African-Americans, he captured 48 percent of Democratic presidential primary voters, crushing Sanders by nearly 30 percentage points and making up lots of lost ground to the populist senator from Vermont in the all-important race for convention delegates. But the true test for Biden will come this week on ""Super Tuesday"" – when 14 states from coast-to-coast, including delegate-rich behemoths like California and Texas, hold primaries that offer a potential combined prize of a third of all nomination delegates. Biden is hoping his impressive victory in South Carolina – long considered his campaign firewall – will give him plenty of free media coverage and momentum heading into Super Tuesday and help him make up for plenty of lost ground to both Sanders and multibillionaire Mike Bloomberg in the coming contests. Biden is at a big disadvantage in the Super Tuesday states – especially in delegate-rich California where he has only one office and has been outspent on advertising by both Sanders and Bloomberg. He also trails in the polls in California and Texas by a large margin to Sanders. The former vice president deflected questions by moderator Chris Wallace about the future of his campaign if he gets “clobbered” on Super Tuesday where 34 percent of the Democratic delegates will be awarded, saying only that there are other delegate-heavy states still in play following Tuesday’s votes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “There are a lot of big states coming up after that – Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan,” Biden said. “I feel good about where we are and ultimately people are beginning to focus on the opposition the way they focused on me for a long time.” “It’s about the message,” he added. On the front-runner Sanders, Biden noted that he would support him if he was the nominee, but that the self-described Democratic socialist would make it difficult for Democratic candidates down ballot. “You can’t run as an Independent Socialist, now a Democratic Socialist, and do particularly -- expect to do very well in the states we have to win, like North Carolina, like Georgia, like Florida, like Texas, like Pennsylvania, et cetera,” Biden said. “I believe that if I’m on the top of the ticket we will win back the Senate and we’ll keep the House. I went in last time in 2018 to 24 purple states, we won 41 House seats, we won governor seats.” Fox News’ Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",1,
Breitbart,Rahm Emanuel: Don’t Use The Word Mandate for COVID Vaccine — Say ‘Requirements for Access’,"Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on ABC’s “This Week” that officials should avoid using the word “mandate” when discussing requiring the COVID-19 vaccine. Emanuel said, “I would not use the word mandate.” He continued, “Call it a requirement, a requirement to participate in the rest of the economy that is opening up.” Emanuel added, “Look, the first 60% you can do in masks. The last 40% you have to do strategically. I would not use the word mandate. We’re requiring this for X access to the economy. You have to think about people in that way. I think that whether you take public employees — as I said, health care workers should lead. They have to get vaccinated. You get federal dollars for research at universities. Students and employees have to be. You start setting requirements for the rest of society. The other piece I would add, it’s part of your national pledge. The one thing he said, and you can see happening, as the variant gets more dangerous, the population it affects starts to go down the age group. We’re going to get to a time where one of these variants beats the vaccine. The question is can we beat the variant?” Follow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN",1,

Breitbart,Report: Vaccinated Comprise 75% of Coronavirus Infections in Singapore,"Vaccinated individuals comprise the majority of new coronavirus infections in Singapore, according to government data. According to Reuters, vaccinated peoplemade upthree-quarters of the country’s coronavirus infections in the last month, although severe cases among the vaccinated have been limited: While the data shows that vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases, it also underscores the risk that even those inoculated could be contagious, so that inoculation alone may not suffice to halt transmission. Of Singapore’s 1,096 locally transmitted infections in the last 28 days, 484, or about 44%, were in fully vaccinated people, while 30% were partially vaccinated and just over 25% were unvaccinated, Thursday’s data showed. “There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected,” the health ministry said in a statement, noting fully vaccinated people generally exhibit mild symptoms or none at all. Singapore boasts a high vaccination rate, as 75 percent of the 5.7 million in the country have received the jab. The Singapore Ministry of Healthannouncedin early July that it would only count recipients of the American made Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as vaccinated for the purposes of national statistics. Vaccinated individuals who have contracted the coronavirus are presumably recipients of one of the American products. Individuals who received other options such as Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine or one of several Chinese products officially count as unvaccinated. The news comes as the Biden White House urges Americans to get vaccinated as the delta variant spreads across the U.S. Notably, White House press secretary Jen Psaki cited findings revealing that vaccinated people are more concerned about the variant’s spread than the unvaccinated. “I believe it was a CBS poll — that showed that vaccinated people in the country are more fearful about the Delta variant than unvaccinated people,” shesaid. “That’s clearly concerning to us because unvaccinated people should be more fearful. And what the President wanted to convey to people in the country is the impact and effect of getting vaccinated,” she added. Meanwhile, Texas state Rep. Donna Howard (D), one of the fully vaccinated Texas state lawmakers who tested for the coronavirus after fleeing to Washington, D.C., alongside her maskless colleagues to prevent House Republicans from pursuing election integrity measures, is now among thosecallingfor a universal mask mandate.",0,

Scientists are working hard to understand how antibodies could be used to design an effective vaccine for the novelcoronavirusthat has killed more than 24,737 people in the U.S. and infected almost 2 million worldwide. The image below shows a human antibody, which is a blood protein that our immune systems make to destroy viruses and other invaders in our bodies. This antibody is called CR3022, depicted in yellow, and is shown bound to the surface of the novel coronavirus (in white). Researchers with the Scripps Institute in California utilized high-resolution X-ray crystallography tools in a paper recently published in the journalScienceto capture the antibody's atomic structure. Each antibody is only about 10 nanometers, or one-billionth of a meter. NATURAL LIGHT, FRESH AIR COULD KEEP CORONAVIRUS OUT OF WORKPLACES Scientists are studying the novel coronavirus to find potential weak spots in its molecular structure.(Meng Yuan and Nicholas Wu, Wilson Lab, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) The scientists were hoping to figure out exactly where the antibody attaches to the deadly virus. If those more vulnerable areas can be pinpointed, scientists will be able to use that information in designing a vaccine. One of their findings is that the antibody binds on a similar site in both the SARS and novel coronaviruses. ""The human antibody shown in this image locks onto the virus’s spike protein at a different location than where the human ACE2 protein binds to the novel coronavirus. Intriguingly, the antibody binds to a spot on the novel coronavirus that is usually hidden, except for when [the] virus shapeshifts its structure in order to infect a cell,"" Dr. Francis Collins said on the National Institutes of Health (NIH)Director's Blog. APPLE AND GOOGLE PARTNER ON CORONAVIRUS TRACING EFFORT According to Collins, the findings suggest that a possible successful vaccine could elicit antibodies to ""target this same spot, but binds more tightly than the one seen in the image above, thereby protecting human cells against the virus that causes COVID-19.""

AP News,"Video of Burkina Faso massacre appears to implicate government-allied militia, watchdog says","DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Video footage circulating on social networks of a recent civilian massacre inBurkina Fasoappears to implicate government-allied militia,Human Rights Watchsaid, calling on authorities to investigate and prosecute all those responsible. According to testimonies collected by the watchdog, security forces and allied militias carried out large-scale operations in the Solenzo countryside on Monday and Tuesday, and targeted displaced Fulani in apparent retaliatory attacks against the community, which the government has long accused of supporting Muslim militants. “The gruesome videos of an apparent massacre by pro-government militias in Burkina Faso underscore the pervasive lack of accountability of these forces,” Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, adding that the authorities “should take immediate action to end militia group attacks on civilians by punishing those responsible for atrocities like in Solenzo.” The Burkina Faso government denied the accusations, saying in a statement it “condemned the propagation, on social media, of images inducing hate and community violence, and fake information aimed at undermining social cohesion” in the country. Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million people inSahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, in recent years has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups.  Themilitary junta, which took power in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2.1 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive. Based on video analysis, media reports, and local sources, most victims of the massacre in Solenzo appear to be ethnic Fulani, Human Rights Watch said Friday. At least 58 people appear to be dead or dying in the videos, including at least two children, it said. According to analysts, the junta’s strategy of military escalation, including mass recruitment of civilians for poorly trained militia units, has exacerbated tensions between ethnic groups. Data gathered by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project show that militia attacks on civilians significantly increased since Capt. Ibrahim Traore took power. Human Rights Watch says the country’s armed forces and militias have committed widespread abuses during counterinsurgency operations, including unlawful killings of Fulani civilians accused of supporting Islamist fighters. It it impossible to get an accurate picture of the situation in the country since the military leadership has installed a system of de facto censorship, rights groups said, and those daring to speak up can be openlyabducted, imprisoned or forcefully drafted into the army.",2,
The Guardian,Trump plots revenge as Democrats push on with second impeachment trial,"Republican divisions over Donald Trump’ssecond impeachment trialcame into clearer focus on Sunday, as the former president spent his first weekend out of office plotting revenge against those he says betrayed him.Related:Can Trump do a Nixon and re-enter polite society? Elizabeth Drew doubts itStewing over election defeat by Joe Biden, four days after leaving the White House, Trump continued to drop hints of creating a new party, a threat some saw as a gambit to keep wavering senators in line ahead of the opening of his trial, in the week after 8 February.Democrats will send the single article of impeachment to the Senate for a reading on Monday evening. It alleges incitement of insurrection, regarding the6 January riotat the US Capitol that left five dead, including a police officer.Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, splitting rounds of golf with discussions about maintaining relevance and influence and how to unseat Republicans deemed to have crossed him, theWashington Postreported.Trump, the Post said, had said the threat of starting a Maga (Make America Great Again) or Patriot party, gave him leverage to prevent senators voting to convict, which could lead to him being prevented from seeking office again.Later on Sunday, the New York Times reporter Maggie Habermancitedsources “familiar with his thinking” when she said Trump was backing off his threat to create a new party, after it was “gently pointed out to him” that “threatening a third party while simultaneously threatening primaries makes no sense”.Nonetheless, those in Trump’s crosshairs include Liz Cheney, the No3 House Republican, Georgia governor Brian Kemp and others who declined to embrace false claims of election fraud or accused him of inciting the Capitol riot.Other senior Republicans clashed on Sunday over Trump’s trial and the party’s future. Mitt Romney, the Utah senator, former presidential candidate and fierce Trump critic who was the only Republican to vote for impeachment at his first trial last year, said the former president had exhibited a “continuous pattern” of trying to corrupt elections.“He fired up a crowd, encouraging them to march on the Capitol at the time that the Congress was carrying out its constitutional responsibility to certify the election,” Romney told CNN’s State of the Union. “These allegations are very serious. They haven’t been defended yet by the president. He deserves a chance to have that heard but it’s important for us to go through the normal justice process and for there to be resolution.”Romney said it was constitutional to hold a trial for a president who has left office.“I believe that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offence. If not, what is?”Romney, however, said he did not support action against Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, senators who supported Trump’s claims of a rigged election and objected to results.Related:Chaos of Trump's last days in office reverberates with fresh 'plot' report“I think history will provide a measure of judgment with regard to those that continue to spread the lie that the [former] president began with, as well as the voters in our respective communities,” he said. “I don’t think the Senate needs to take action.”Other Republicans, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, are expected to vote to convict. But the party is deeply fractured. For a conviction, 17 Republicans would need to vote with the 50 Democrats. It is unclear if that number can be reached, despite assertions from minority leader Mitch McConnell that the mob“was fed lies”by Trump.Habermanreportedthat Trump had “started to believe there are fewer votes to convict than there would have been if the vote had been held almost immediately after 6 January”.Marco Rubio of Florida said he thought the trial was “stupid and counterproductive”.“We already have a flaming fire in this country and it’s like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire,” he told Fox News Sunday.“I look back in time, for exampleRichard Nixon, who had clearly committed crimes and wrongdoing. In hindsight I think we would all agree that President Ford’s pardon was important for the country to be able to move forward. I think this is going to be really bad for the country, it’s just going to stir it up even more and make it even harder to get things done.”John Cornyn of Texas threatened retaliation,tweeting: “If it is a good idea to impeach and try former presidents, what about former Democratic presidents when Republicans get the majority in 2022? Think about it and let’s do what is best for the country.”Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, said he believed the impeachment was unconstitutional, telling NBC’s Meet the Press: “[The US constitution] specifically pointed out that you can impeach the president and it does not indicate that you can impeach someone who is not in office. So I think it’s a moot point.Related:Courtrooms and creditors likely to loom large in Trump's post-presidency life“But for right now there are other things we’d rather be working on. The Biden administration would love more of their cabinet in place and there’s a number of Republicans that feel the same way. We should allow this president the opportunity to form his cabinet and get that in place as quickly as possible.”Republican unity appears increasingly rare. On Saturday, the Arizona Republican party voted tocensure Cindy McCain, the widow of the former senator and presidential candidate John McCain, and two other prominent party members who have crossed Trump.The actions drew swift praise from the former president, who backed Kelli Ward, the firebrand state party chair who was the architect of the censure, and who recently won a narrow re-election.Trump, thePostreported, called Ward to offer his “complete and total endorsement”.",1,
Fox News,"Coronavirus droplets could travel 27 feet, warns MIT researcher","Learn why Americans are still ignoring social distancing rules amid coronavirus, despite increasing risks. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.Sign up here. AnMITresearcher has warned thatcoronavirusdroplets could travel up to 27 feet, which could have major implications for social distancing. Lydia Bourouiba, Ph.D., an associate professor at MIT and expert in fluid dynamics, explained that a sneeze, for example, results in a turbulent gas cloud that could contain coronavirus droplets. The research was published in theJournal of the American Medical Association. “Recent work has demonstrated that exhalations, sneezes, and coughs not only consist of mucosalivary droplets following short-range semiballistic emission trajectories but, importantly, are primarily made of a multiphase turbulent gas (a puff) cloud that entrains ambient air and traps and carries within it clusters of droplets with a continuum of droplet sizes,” she wrote. CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK LEADS TO NASAL SWABS BEING 3D-PRINTED During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] to maintain social distancing of at least six feet to limit the risk of exposure. However, Bourouiba’s research indicates that the droplets could travel further much further than that. Fox News has reached out to the CDC with a request for comment. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged caution with the study during a White House briefing Tuesday evening. “This could really be terribly misleading,” he said, adding that it would apply only to people with extremely strong sneezes. “Owing to the forward momentum of the cloud, pathogen-bearing droplets are propelled much farther than if they were emitted in isolation without a turbulent puff cloud trapping and carrying them forward,” Bourouiba wrote. “Given various combinations of an individual patient’s physiology and environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, the gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 23 to 27 feet (7-8 m).” Bourouiba explains that the range of the droplets, both large and small, is extended through their interaction with and trapping within the turbulent gas cloud. PANGOLINS CAN CARRY CORONAVIRUS-RELATED STRAINS, SCIENTISTS SAY “Droplets that settle along the trajectory can contaminate surfaces, while the rest remain trapped and clustered in the moving cloud,” she wrote. “Eventually the cloud and its droplet payload lose momentum and coherence, and the remaining droplets within the cloud evaporate, producing residues or droplet nuclei that may stay suspended in the air for hours, following airflow patterns imposed by ventilation or climate-control systems.” In a separate project, experts have used a supercomputer to quickly model the risks posed by viruses on a plane.

Fox News,Biggest contracts in North American team sports: Juan Soto tops select list of $300M players,"It took just one year forJuan Sototo set a new record for the largest contract in sports history. It's anyone's guess how long it will take before his deal with theMetsis surpassed. Soto's 15-year, $765 million pact didn't even include any deferred money, making it worth about $300 million more thanShohei Ohtani's $700 million agreement with theDodgers. Over the years, athletes' salaries have skyrocketed amid billion-dollar television deals. In 1979, Nolan Ryan became the first pro athlete to earn $1 million per season upon signing with theAstros. Now, dozens of NFL players make more than $1 million per game, while the highest-paid NBA players are approaching that figure for a day's work. But the largest overall contract values primarily belong to baseball players.

Fox News,Fauci warns coronavirus cases are 'unacceptably high' as Labor Day weekend approaches,"Dr. Anthony Faucihas warned thatcoronaviruscases remain “unacceptably high” as the nation heads into the Labor Day weekend. During aninterviewthis week, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House's Coronavirus Task Force, urged Americans to follow health and safety measures to prevent the spread of thenovel coronavirus, as this weekend will affect how the virus spreads in the upcoming fall and winter seasons. Speaking with MSNBC on Wednesday, the esteemed immunologist said that if the virus spikes following this weekend, concerns would be intensified into the winter months, when the nation will need to contend with the flu on top of the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies before a House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing on July 31, 2020 in Washington, DC.. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images) He said there are roughly 40,000 new cases per day in the United States and that number needs to be below 10,000 daily. CORONAVIRUS OR WEST NILE? CDC REPORTS 17 CASES OF MOSQUITO DISEASE THAT PRESENT SYMPTOMS SIMILARLY TO COVID-19 “We know from prior experience as you get into the holiday weekend, the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, there’s a tendency of people to be careless somewhat with regard to the public health measures,” Fauci said during the interview with the news outlet. “I want to use this opportunity to almost have a plea to the people in this country to realize that we really still need to get our arms around this and to suppress these types of surges we’ve seen.” This summer, new cases had fallen steadily toward the end of May, but then spikes were reported after the Memorial Day weekend, according to data from Johns Hopkins and multiplereports. CORONAVIRUS INFECTS 14 MEMBERS OF TEXAS FAMILY FOLLOWING BACKYARD BBQ Infectious disease specialist Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York, agreed that people need to be cautious as the Labor Day weekend begins. “Many times community outbreaks were due to large super-spreader events – which improper Labor Day gatherings and relaxation of our vigilance regarding masking and distancing could, heaven forbid, trigger,"" he told Fox News. “Unfortunately, our collective public memory as a community is poor. People need to think back and remember how horrific the pandemic was in March and April, how many lives were shattered and destroyed.” Health experts and U.S. health officials fear the pandemic in the U.S. could get worse as people start to spend more time indoors with the cooler months ahead. “We really still need to get our arms around this and to suppress these types of surges we’ve seen,” Fauci said during his interview with MSNBC. Fauci said Americans can still enjoy their holiday weekend but pleaded that they follow typical safety guidelines in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distance, washing hands, avoiding crowds and holding outdoor events rather than indoor ones.",3,
Fox News,Trump indicted on federal charges related to document handling and obstruction of justice,"Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley reacts to reports former President Donald Trump has been indicted over alleged mishandling of classified documents on Jesse Watters Primetime. Former President Trump has been indicted on federal charges that emerged out ofSpecial Counsel Jack Smith’smonths-long investigation. Trump is listed in the indictment, which has not been unsealed, as a criminal defendant charged with at least seven counts involving obstruction of justice, conspiracy, and illegal retention of classified government material. He has been ordered to appear in federal court in Miami on Tuesday. Trump himself announced the indictment on his social media platform, Truth Social. Sources say federal prosecutors informed Trump's attorneys of the indictment a short time before he revealed it. EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP SAYS INDICTMENT IS ‘ELECTION INTERFERENCE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL’ ""The corrupt Biden Administration has informed my attorneys that I have been Indicted, seemingly over the Boxes Hoax, even thoughJoe Bidenhas 1850 Boxes at the University of Delaware, additional Boxes in Chinatown, D.C., with even more Boxes at the University of Pennsylvania, and documents strewn all over his garage floor where he parks his Corvette, and which is ""secured"" by only a garage door that is paper thin, and open much of the time,"" Trump said on Truth Social. Trump said he has ""been summoned to appear at the Federal Courthouse in Miami on Tuesday, at 3 PM."" This is thesecond time Trump has been indictedthis year. Trump pleaded not guilty in April after being charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Donald Trump is the first former president to be indicted on criminal charges.( SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)) ""I never thought it possible that such a thing could happen to a former President of the United States, who received far more votes than any sitting President in the History of our Country, and is currently leading, by far, all Candidates, both Democrat and Republican, in Polls of the2024 Presidential Election,"" Trump posted. ""I AM AN INNOCENT MAN!"" Trump added: ""This is indeed a DARK DAY for the United States of America. We are a Country in serious and rapid Decline, but together we will Make America Great Again!"" Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to investigate Trump’s alleged improper retention of classified records at hisMar-a-Lago home. TRUMP TARGETED: A LOOK AT PROBES INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT; FROM STORMY DANIELS TO RUSSIA TO MAR-A-LAGO The Justice Department had beeninvestigating the matterafter the FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on his private residence in August 2022. NARA told Congress in February 2022 that Trumptook 15 boxesof presidential records to his personal residence in Florida. NARA recovered the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago and ""identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes."" The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA. TRUMP LAWYERS MEET OFFICIALS AT DOJ AS SPECIAL COUNSEL PROBE ON CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS NEAR END Those boxes allegedly contained ""classified national security information,"" and official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state. Classified material that was reportedly confiscated by the FBI during the FBI's raid in August included a letter to Trump from former President Obama, a letter from Kim Jong Un, a birthday dinner menu and a cocktail napkin. Former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media during an election night event at Mar-a-Lago on November 08, 2022 in Palm Beach, Florida.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Trump last year said the National Archives did not ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request."" Sources close to the former president said he had been cooperating and there was ""no need"" for the raid. The affidavit said that the FBI's investigation had ""established that documents bearing classification markings, which appear to contain National Defense Information (NDI), were among the materials contained"" in the 15 boxes Trump initially turned over to the NARA. ""A preliminary triage of the documents with classification markings revealed the following approximate numbers: 184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET,"" the affidavit states. FLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS The FBI said it had ""probable cause to believe"" that additional records containing classified information, including National Defense Information, would be found on the premises of Mar-a-Lago home, beyond what he had previously turned over to the NARA, according to the unsealed and heavily-redacted affidavit used to justify the raid. A Secret Service agent and a security guard officer guard the Mar-a-Lago home of former U.S. President Donald Trump, in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. March 31, 2023.(REUTERS/Ricardo Arduengo) According to the property receipt from theAug. 8, 2022 FBI raid, FBI agents took approximately 20 boxes of items from the premises, including one set of documents marked as ""Various classified/TS/SCI documents,"" which refers to top secret/sensitive compartmented information. Records covered by that government classification level could potentially include human intelligence and information that, if disclosed, could jeopardize relations between the U.S. and other nations, as well as the lives of intelligence operatives abroad. However, the classification also encompasses national security information related to the daily operations of the president of the United States. FLASHBACK: FBI SEIZED CLASSIFIED RECORDS FROM MAR-A-LAGO DURING SEARCH OF TRUMP RESIDENCE WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 18: U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland delivers remarks at the U.S. Justice Department Building on November 18, 2022 in Washington, DC. Garland announced he will appoint a special counsel to oversee the Justice Department’s investigation into former President Donald Trump and his handling of classified documents and actions before the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol Building. Garlands pick to oversee the special counsel is Jack Smith, an international criminal court prosecutor. Garland spoke alongside Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite and U.S attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves.((Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)) The property receipt also showed that FBI agents collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents and three sets of confidential documents, but the document does not reveal any details about any of those records. The government conducted the search in response to what it believed to be a violation of federal laws: 18 USC 793 — gathering, transmitting or losing defense information; 18 USC 2071 — concealment, removal or mutilation; and 18 USC 1519 — destruction, alteration or falsification of records in federal investigations. FLASHBACK: FBI SAID IT HAD 'PROBABLE CAUSE' TO BELIEVE ADDITIONAL CLASSIFIED DOCS REMAINED AT MAR-A-LAGO, AFFIDAVIT SAYS The allegation of ""gathering, transmitting or losing defense information"" falls under the Espionage Act. The indictment comes after classified records were alsodiscovered in President Biden’s officeat the Penn Biden Center last year. Those records were from his time as vice president during the Obama administration and from his tenure in the U.S. Senate. Former President Donald Trump told Columbia Journalism Review he had to fight off ""unbelievably fake stories"" during his presidency.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) At the time, Garland initially chose U.S. Attorney John Lausch to conduct a review of classified records that were discovered at the Penn Biden Center. In December, more classified records were found at Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware home, but the discoveries were not made public until this year. Garland later appointed U.S. Attorney Robert Hur as special counsel to investigateBiden’s improper retention of classified records. Hur took over the DOJ investigation from Lausch. Meanwhile, classified records were also found atformer Vice President Mike Pence’s homein Indiana. Fox News reported last week that the Justice Department had completed its investigation in the matter and that Pence will not be charged.

The Guardian,Rishi Sunak’s empty boasting about ‘halving inflation’ can’t hide his economic failures | James Meadway,"Rishi Sunak is boasting about his “achievement” inhalving inflation. Like the fly on the ox’s neck congratulating itself on a hard day’s ploughing, neither he, nor his government, nor even the Bank of England and its interest rate rises, deserve the credit for falling inflation, which is driven by falling global energy prices.When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the disruption to oil and natural gas supplies across Europe was immediate,with prices for natural gassurging to 10 times their pre-invasion level. Inflation, which measures average price rises over the previous 12 months,soared to 40-year highs in Britainand for other heavy users of natural gassuch as Germany. But as the initial shock wore off and energy prices started to come down from the middle of last year, overall inflation everywhere has started to fall.The price of gas in Qatar or Norway is not affected by the rate of interest in London. The policy that most affected UK inflation, instead, was the energy price guarantee, which capped the price faced by households for their energy use. The Office for Budget Responsibility thinks the energy price guarantee cut inflation, at its peak,by 2.5 percentage points. But the guarantee was introduced by the much-maligned Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng – Sunak and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, have steadily reduced its level of support as global energy prices have fallen.Politically, Sunak will be hoping for a repeat of the good fortune that struck David Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, in late 2014. Fearing the rise of US shale production, OPEC, urged on by Saudi Arabia,decided against production cutsin November that year, aiming to flood the global market for oil, depress its price and subsequently crushheavily indebted US shale producersas their output became unprofitable.This didn’t work as intended: shale production in the US, after a brief dip, has grown rapidly, turning the US into anet fossil fuel exporterby the end of 2019. But at the time the global price of oil still fell very rapidly, dragging other prices down with it. UK inflation fell for months,briefly turning negative(meaning prices falling overall) in April 2015. The real value of wages and salaries, which take account of price changes and had declined consistently since Cameron became prime minister, now finally started to pick up a little.Related:David Cameron’s Tory party is dead – and its ghost can’t save Rishi Sunak | Rafael BehrThis sudden good fortune had nothing to do with Cameron’s government, but was still a political disaster for Labour. It killed the party’s well-used attack line on the “Tory cost of living crisis” and allowed the Conservatives to claim their vicious austerity spending cuts were working – handily in time for the May 2015 election, which Cameron won by a slender majority.A lower headline rate of inflation today is unlikely to have the same impact. The rate is still high, compared with recent decades, at more than double the Bank of England’s official target. Real wages and salaries are barely rising, and are still lower than they were two years ago. Interest rate rises haveyet to hit borrowers fully, with 2.4m fixed-rate deals still to expire between now and the end of 2024. And food prices, which people tend to notice very quickly, are still very high, upabout 10%over the last year.Just as Joe Biden is seeing in the US, improving headline economic statistics can still mean people feel worse off because,in reality, they are. Sunak’s meretricious bragging can’t hide real economic failure.James Meadway is the host of the Macrodose podcast",2,
Fox News,"Bats offer COVID-19 treatment clues, scientists say","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Bats offer important clues for the treatment ofCOVID-19, scientists say. The virus is believed to haveoriginatedin bats and then jumped to humans via an intermediary species, possibly the anteater-likepangolinthat is prized in China for its scales used in Chinese medicine as well as its meat. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, bats have been also been identified as a natural reservoir for other deadly viruses, such as Ebola and rabies, according to researchers at the University of Rochester. RESEARCHERS FIND 6 NEW CORONAVIRUSES IN BATS However, bats have long fascinated scientists as a result of their ability to withstand viruses. “Although humans experience adverse symptoms when afflicted with these pathogens, bats are remarkably able to tolerate viruses, and, additionally, live much longer than similar-sized land mammals,” the University of Rochester researchers explain in astatement. Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri) flying in cave, Europe - file photo.(Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) In a review article published in the journalCell Metabolism, the scientists examine why bats are seemingly unaffected by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, while discussing their unusual lifespans. “Generally, a species’ lifespan correlates with its body mass; the smaller a species, the shorter its lifespan, and vice versa,” they explain, in the statement. “Many bat species, however, have lifespans of 30 to 40 years, which is impressive for their size.” The research came about when University of Rochester biology professors Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov were in Singapore in March prior to COVID-19-linked travel bans. After Singapore went into lockdown, the professors, who are married, quarantined at the home of their colleague Brian Kennedy, director of the Centre for Healthy Aging at the National University of Singapore. Kennedy co-authored the paper with Gorbunova and Seluanov during their quarantine. 7 STRAINS OF CORONAVIRUS FOUND IN BATS IN AFRICA, STUDY FINDS “With COVID-19, the inflammation goes haywire, and it may be the inflammatory response that is killing the patient, more so than the virus itself,” Gorbunova says. “The human immune system works like that: Once we get infected, our body sounds an alarm and we develop a fever and inflammation. The goal is to kill the virus and fight infection, but it can also be a detrimental response as our bodies overreact to the threat.” Bats, however, have developed “specific mechanisms that reduce viral replication and also dampen the immune response to a virus,” according to the researchers. As a result, bats’ immune systems control viruses but do not mount “a strong inflammatory response,” the scientists said. Flight may offer a clue. “Bats are the only mammals with the ability to fly, which requires that they adapt to rapid increases in body temperature, sudden surges in metabolism, and molecular damage,” the scientists said. “These adaptations may also assist in disease resistance.” NEW CORONAVIRUS FOUND IN BATS IS 'CLOSEST RELATIVE' TO SARS-COV-2 SEEN YET Additionally, bats live together in large, dense colonies where pathogens and viruses can be easily transmitted. “Bats are constantly exposed to viruses,” said Seluanov, in the statement. “They are always flying out and bringing back something new to the cave or nest, and they transfer the virus because they live in such close proximity to each other.” This, according to the researchers, means that their immune systems are constantly in an “arms race” with pathogens. “Usually the strongest driver of new traits in evolution is an arms race with pathogens,” said Gorbunova. “Dealing with all of these viruses may be shaping bats’ immunity and longevity.” This, the researchers said, is not an invitation “for humans to toss their masks and crowd together in restaurants and movie theaters.” The scientists note that evolution takes place over thousands of years, not a few months. PANGOLINS CAN CARRY CORONAVIRUS-RELATED STRAINS, SCIENTISTS SAY It has only been in modern history that the majority of the human population has begun living in close proximity in cities, they explain, also citing developments in mobility and global travel. “While humans may be developing social habits that parallel those of bats, we have not yet evolved bats’ sophisticated mechanisms to combat viruses as they emerge and swiftly spread,” they say. One possible result of this is that our bodies experience more inflammation than bats, according to Gorbunova. Aging also appears to be a factor in humans’ response to COVID-19, they explain. Set against this backdrop, analysis of bats’ immune systems could provide new targets for human therapies to fight diseases and aging, according to the researchers. “For example, bats have mutated or completely eliminated several genes involved in inflammation; scientists can develop drugs to inhibit these genes in humans,” they explain, in the statement. The University of Rochester professors are hoping to start a new research program working toward that goal. WHO SAYS CORONAVIRUS ORIGINATED IN BATS, DENIES IT WAS 'MANIPULATED OR CONSTRUCTED' IN A LAB “Humans have two possible strategies if we want to prevent inflammation, live longer, and avoid the deadly effects of diseases like COVID-19,” Gorbunova said. “One would be to not be exposed to any viruses, but that’s not practical. The second would be to regulate our immune system more like a bat.” In another project, researchers recently announced thediscoveryof six new coronaviruses in bats in Myanmar. Another research effortfoundseven new strains of coronavirus in bats living in a cave in Gabon, Africa, according toreports.

Fox News,"WSJ columnist: Critical race theory is a 'hustle,' produces more 'woke illiterates'","Fauci getting criticized for saying 'no doubt' children 3 years and older should wear masks, a CNN anchor dismissing critical race theory as a creation of Republicans, and a Texas State Democrat getting mocked for calling himself a 'fugitive' after fleeing the state to block voting bills round out today's top media headlines Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley likenedcritical race theoryto a ""hustle"" in a new opinion piece on Tuesday, arguing it not only sends the wrong message to students, but hampers academic progress at a time when math and reading statistics were already at alarming levels. Riley cited Education Department data to note that a majority of fourth- and eighth-graders can't read or do math at grade level, wondering then about the aim of CRT proponents.

""Allocating more time and effort away from core subjects like math and science could theoretically harm those outcomes,"" DeAngelis said. ""But the bigger issue is that teachers unions shouldn't have the power to decide how or what to teach everyone else's children when they can't even get the basics right. The latest results from the Nation's Report Card show that only 22% of 12th-grade students are proficient in science, for example."" DeAngelis argued that families should be allowed to take their children's education dollars to education providers ""that best align with their values.""

The Guardian,Biden has paved the way for Trump’s egregious flouting of international rules | Mohamad Bazzi,"Donald Trumpwants to revive American imperialism. For weeks, the president-elect has threatened to seize Greenland and the Panama Canal,possibly by military force. And he promised supporters that he wouldpressure Canada, through economic warfare, to become the 51st US state. Trump’s repeated threats to undermine borders and use force have alarmed US allies, who are worried that, even if he’s not serious, the incoming president is eager to disregard decades-old norms about respecting territorial integrity and deploying military power.Early in Trump’s first term in office, it became clear that he has contempt for international law and therules-based orderput in place after the end of the second world war to contain conflict between world powers. But this time, Trump is motivated not just by his disdain for global institutions and norms – or even the “madman theory” of foreign policy, where a president will try to appear unpredictable, or irrational, as a negotiating tactic to throw adversaries off balance.Trump has been emboldened by the recent actions of world leaders who were supposedly far more concerned with preserving international peace and security.Joe Bidenand other western leaders prepared the ground for Trump over the past 15 months, as they defied and weakened international law to protect Israel while it waged a devastating war on Gaza.Here’s a summary of how western officials, especially theBiden administration, have repeatedly undermined international institutions and law to shield Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from consequences for their war crimes in Gaza:Shortly after South Africa filed a case in late December 2023 against Israel at the international court of justice (ICJ) accusing it of carrying out a genocide in Gaza, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken,dismissed the petitionas “meritless” and said it would distract from US efforts to secure humanitarian aid. Weeks later, the court, which is the UN’s highest judicial body, allowed the case to move forward and ordered Israel to preventacts of genocideby its troops in Gaza, and to allow more aid into the besieged territory. Israel, along with its western allies, ignored the court’s decision.The Biden administration quickly exposed itself to charges of hypocrisy over its refusal to support the international court’s rulings on Israel, when Washingtonhad urgedUS adversaries to abide by past ICJ decisions, especially after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The court’s orders are binding on its member states, but the ICJ does not have an enforcement mechanism aside from referring matters to the UN security council, where the Biden administration has used itsveto power four timessince October 2023 to protect Israel from demands for a ceasefire.In May, Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), another tribunal based in The Hague, announced he was seeking arrest warrantsfor Israeli leadersfor war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. The prosecutor sought warrants against Netanyahu, and Israel’s then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as three top Hamas leaders who had organized the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Biden and his top aides immediately sided with Israel, andcalled the decisionto charge Netanyahu and Gallant “outrageous”. US politicians also threatened toimpose sanctionsagainst Khan and other ICC officials.On 24 May, the ICJ issued another ruling, ordering Israel tostop its military assaulton the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had taken refuge after being driven out of their homes in other parts of the enclave. The ruling was the closest that the world’s top court has come to ordering a ceasefire in Gaza – and it exposed how Israel’s closest allies, the US and the UK, would continue to flout international law and institutions to protect Netanyahu’s government.On 21 November, the ICC finallyissued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and Gallant on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity. It was the first time that leaders of a western-aligned state have been charged by the court since it was established in 2002 under the Rome statute. Netanyahu and Gallant face the risk of arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that signed the statute, although several European signatories, including Germany and France, have not committedto enforcing the arrest warrants. Biden again denounced the ICC’s move against Israeli leaders, even though he hadapplauded the court’s decisionin 2023 to issue an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for war crimes in Ukraine.The Biden administration could have used these international rulings and Israel’s growing isolation as leverage to stop sending billions in US weapons to Israel and force Netanyahu to end the war. Instead, Biden and his top aides worked for nearly a year to discredit international courts and prosecutors in order to protect Israel. After Trump’s disastrous first term, Biden had entered office in 2021 promising to put protection of human rights at thecenter of US foreign policy. But he acted like past American presidents, who waged or sustained US wars abroad while delivering grandiose rhetoric about respect for democracy and human rights. Biden laid bare the reality of his policies with his unconditional support for Israel’s assault on Gaza.Biden and his advisers also exposed the US to potential complicity in war crimes, considering that Washington is, by far, Israel’s largest arms supplier. Since October 2023, the Biden administrationspent a staggering $22.7bnin taxpayer funds to provide Israel with weapons, other security assistance and additional costs for direct US military activities in the Middle East due to the Gaza war.For 15 months, Biden continued providing Netanyahu with US weapons and political cover at the UN, while Israel acted with impunity in Gaza. Is it any surprise that Trump would see Biden’s trampling of international law and supposed norms as a green light to exert US power in even cruder terms – to threaten a military takeover of Greenland or an invasion to reclaim US control over the Panama Canal?Western punditsare outragedthat Trump’s expansionist rhetoric, even if it is intended as trolling or a distraction, will embolden traditional US adversaries like Russia and China to seize territory in Ukraine or Taiwan. But this ignores the severe damage that presumably rational leaders like Biden have already done to the international order.Once western leaders rendered international law meaningless in Gaza – allowing Israel to disregard the ICJ and ICC, and continuecommitting war crimes– no amount of lofty rhetoric could hide the hypocrisy and double standards of the US and other world powers. Gaza shattered the remaining facade of an international rule of law – and Trump is eager to take advantage of the ensuing chaos.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor at New York University",1,
BBC News,Trump calls judge 'evil' for releasing case files before election,"Donald Trump has called a judge ""the most evil person"" as she released more than 1,800 pages of evidence in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election conspiracy case against him. The Republican White House candidate said US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan's rejection of his request to delay releasing the new evidence until after next month's vote amounted to ""election interference"". Legal analysts have debated whether filings in the case breach a justice department internal rule that prosecutors avoid any investigative step that might affect an election within 60 days of voting. But in her ruling, Judge Chutkan argued that if she had kept the files under wraps, that could itself have been construed as election interference. ""If the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute - or appear to be - election interference,"" she wrote. Last year, a Texas woman was charged with making death threats against Judge Chutkan, citing the Trump case. The heavily redacted 1,889 pages of documents released on Friday mostly rehash information already available publicly, including parts of former Vice-President Mike Pence's biography and his formal announcement that he would not overturn the 2020 election results. The new evidence is a part of a motion filed by Mr Smith last month. Appearing on Friday during a podcast with right-wing media personality Dan Bongino, Trump lambasted Judge Chutkan and called the special counsel ""a sick puppy"". The indictment centres on the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot and accuses Trump of illegally conspiring to overturn his election defeat three months earlier to Joe Biden. During the interview, Trump also likened the detention of those charged with storming the Capitol to the US internment of Japanese Americans in World War Two. ""Why are they still being held? Nobody's ever been treated like this,"" he said. ""Maybe the Japanese during Second World War, frankly."" Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump cannot be prosecuted for official acts carried out as president. As a result, Mr Smith was forced to change the historic case brought against Trump and argue that he committed crimes while still in office, but as a private citizen. He filed a new motion in September laying out the new case against the former president, which included allegations that Trump promoted false claims of election fraud despite believing them to be ""crazy"". The motion also included new details on how Trump's relationship with Pence deteriorated, with the former vice-president telling Trump to stop repeating false election fraud theories and move on. The documents released on Friday include transcripts of interviews with the 6 January House committee that investigated the US Capitol riot, parts of Penceâs autobiography and fundraising emails sent to voters. It is unclear if the 6 January case will ever go to trial. Trump is expected to end the prosecution if he returns to the White House. He is facing several other criminal cases. He already has been convicted on 34 felony counts in New York in relation to a hush-money payment.

We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas’s rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal,” the senior official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Critics of the US request say it will hinder engagement with elements of Hamas potentially more inclined to compromise, and could boost the influence of more hostile states, such as Iran, over the group.Hamas still holds about 100 hostages seized during its surprise attack intoIsraellast October. Multiple rounds of negotiations aimed at securing an end to the 13 month-long war in Gaza have failed.The small but influential Gulf state has been a key intermediary in the talks to broker a ceasefire and is likely to comply with the US request, analysts said.

The Guardian,"Dogs may be better at detecting Covid-19 than nasal PCR tests, study finds","Trained dogs may be able to detect Covid-19 more effectively than nasal swab PCR tests, according to new research.A studypublishedon Wednesday by the peer-reviewed Plos One journal found that canines were able to better detect the presence of Covid than PCR antigenic tests in both symptomatic and asymptomatic people.Related:‘A protective bubble’: Covid-sniffing dogs help scientists – and Metallica – spot infectionIn the study, trained dogs were able to detect Covid in 97% of symptomatic cases and nearly 100% of asymptomatic cases.“The dog doesn’t lie,” Dominique Grandjean, a professor at the Alfort National Veterinary School in France and a study author,told Science News, noting that different errors can occur with PCR tests.The study featured 335 participants from Covid screening centers in Paris. Of the participants, 109 were positive with Covid, including 31 who were asymptomatic.The detection dogs, provided by French fire stations and the United Arab Emirates, received three to six weeks of training, depending on if a dog was previously trained for odor detection.The dogs sniffed samples of human sweat placed in an olfaction cone. If a dog detected Covid, it sat down in front of the cone.Ultimately, the trained dogs were more sensitive to positive cases. Nasal PCR tests were better able to better detect negative cases.In two false positive cases, dogs falsely identified other coronavirus respiratory illness strains that were not Covid.While there have been previous studies on the capability of dogs to detect Covid, this is believed to be the first to compare the accuracy of dogs to antigenic tests.A study published in Mayby researchers in the UK found that trained dogs could detect Covid with an accuracy of 82% to 94%,NBC Newsreported.A 2021 study in Floridafound that dogs had a 73% to 93% accuracy rate after a month of training.The authors of the French study said more dogs could soon be used to detect Covid in mass screening settings including airports.PCR tests can take days to deliver a result. The trained dogs were able to analyze 20 samples in just 15 seconds, Grandjeantold NBC.Using dogs for Covid testing could also benefit those who have trouble tolerating nasal swabs, such as patients with Alzheimer’s, the authors said.Experts not affiliated with the study warn that translating its positive results into everyday use could prove difficult.“The ideal – and I would consider it the Holy Grail – is that the dog is just standing there, a person walks by, and they say, ‘Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no,’” Dr Cynthia Otto, director of the Penn Vet Working Dog Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told NBC.“That eventually could be done, but making sure it’s done with all the proper controls and quality assurances and safety – it’s a big step. I haven’t seen anyone who has proposed how to make that transition in a way that’s scientific and safe.”Dogs are starting to be used at mass testing sites. In September 2021, Miami international airportwas the first US airportto deploy Covid dogs.Airports in theUAE, Finland and other countriesuse dogs to sniff out Covid. Schools inMassachusettsandHawaiihave also employed dogs to test students.",3,
Jacobin,Jacobin,"One person, one vote? Well, if corporations are people, it only makes sense that those corporations get the right to vote. Delaware politicians want to get out the vote to corporations. (Hunters Race / Unsplash) Our new issue, “Bye Bye Bidenism,” is out now.Subscribeto our print edition at a discounted rate today. Located along the Nanticoke River in Sussex County, Delaware, near its border with Maryland, Seaford is a scenic small town of about seven thousand. Thanks to the recent efforts of municipal officials and Republican lawmakers in the state’s house of representatives, it may also soon be the site of a radical right-wing experiment that cuts at the basic fabric of democracy. Delaware is one among only three states that allows nonresidents to vote in local elections. And roughly sixty years ago, it altered its state code to allow municipalities with populations exceeding one thousand to establish “home rule charters” that, among other things, empower them to determine voting eligibility. It all sounds innocuous enough. What, after all, could possibly be wrong with extending the franchise? Some cities in Delaware already allow nonresident property owners to vote in their elections. But under a new proposal backed by Seaford’s mayor andcurrently making its waythrough the state legislature, municipal voting rights would also be extended to nonresident owners of limited liability companies, corporations, and trusts. In other words, businesses and corporate entities themselves would become eligible to vote. “These provisions,”the bill’s textreads, “shall be construed in accordance with the principle of ‘one person/entity/one vote.’” What that anodyne phraseology expresses is an essentially pre-democratic idea of governance. According to this logic, which would have been perfectly at home in many societies before the American and French revolutions, property rather than personhood is the preeminent source of political and social legitimacy. For his part, Seaford’s mayor, David Genshaw, has defended the idea on stakeholder grounds. “These are the people we’re trying to attract to our community that we’re asking to invest, to hire,” hetolda local TV network. “Why wouldn’t we want to give them a right to vote? I find it hard to believe, who wouldn’t want that to happen? These are folks that have fully invested in their community with the money, with their time, with their sweat. We want them to have a voice if they choose to take it.” Officially, of course, corporate entities aren’t getting more voting power than individual citizens. Under the legislation, Seaford residents who also own businesses would not receive two votes. But nonresident business ownerswould, in effect, because they would also retain the right to cast a ballot wherever they live — a blatant violation of the principle “one person, one vote” and strongly favoring affluent people who own businesses. The real problem, however, is the idea of extending voting rights to private entities in the first place. For one thing, the whole concept is wide open for fraud. Inone Newark referendum several years ago, a single local property manager voted some thirty-one times (once for every LLC he controlled), prompting its city council to ban the practice of artificial entities casting votes. Even if such cases of fraud could somehow be regulated away, the extension of voting rights to abstract entities at all would represent a Trojan horse for the final replacement of democracy by legally enshrined class rule. Its potential implications are made especially vivid if we consider the case of Delaware itself. “The State of Delaware,”boaststhe appropriately named corp.delaware.gov, “is a leading domicile for U.S. and international corporations. More than 1,000,000 business entities have made Delaware their legal home.” Indeed,according tothe public interest group Common Cause, there are currently more registered businesses in the state than there are actual people — meaning that, if scaled up statewide, corporate entities (or rather, those who own them) would collectively wield greater political clout than citizens. Genshaw himself inadvertently gave the game away whendefending the proposalto reporters: “I mean, Walmart is not going to participate in a local election. They could, legally, I suppose, once the charter change is made, but the intent from the start is to allow local people to vote who are already participating locally in other ways.” America’s political system is already awash with organized money, and its democracy has already been hideously contorted by private interest groups that have successfully normalized the idea that money equals speech. The proposal currently being debated in Delaware, versions of which havealready become lawin a number of other towns, reflects the logical and dangerous end point of such a view: that property conveys special authority, and that those who own it have greater moral worth than their fellow citizens.

He wrote that he wanted to know how Zelenskiy was coping for an upcoming programme “but got so much more.”The UK-based Royal United Services Institute defence and security thinktank published a paper on Wednesday that examined the early days of the Russian invasion in February.A few snippetsfrom the report’s executive summary. It believes that a Ukrainian victory is possible, but “it requires significant heavy fighting”. The paper says that according to operational data from the Ukrainian general staff, Russia had a 12:1 advantage over the Ukrainian forces north of Kyiv in the immediate aftermath of the invasion.More than 1,300 prisoners have been returned toUkrainesince Russian troops invaded, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday.Zelenskiy was speaking after a new exchange of 50 prisoners with Russian and pro-Russian forces. “After today’s exchange, there are already 1,319 heroes who returned home,” Zelenskiy said on Instagram,posting a photoshowing a few dozen men holding Ukrainian flags.The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was too early reach a verdict on talks between Poland and Germany about sending the Patriot air-defence systems from Germany toUkraine.“We all agree on the urgent need to help Ukraine, including with air defence systems,” Stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz.8.48pmGMTUkrainian servicemen of the Armed Forces will now be allowed to take a paid leave during martial law, Euromaidan reports.According to a new law adopted on Thursday, every Ukrainian serviceman is now allowed to take an annual paid leave of ten days.“In a special period during martial law, military personnel may be granted a part of the annual basic leave, as well as leave for family reasons and for other valid reasons with preservation of financial support,” Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zaliznyakwroteon Telegram.No more than 30 percent of the total number of servicemen of a certain category and unit is allowed to be absent at the same time, he added.8.14pmGMTUkraine’s General Staff has announced that Russia is withdrawing some of its military units and is preparing to evacuate occupation personnel from certain settlements across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports.⚡️General Staff: Russian troops withdraw from some settlements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.Russia is withdrawing some of its military units and preparing to evacuate occupation administration personnel from some settlements in the region, Ukraine's General Staff said.— The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent)December 1, 20227.53pmGMTRussian publishers at a leading Moscow bookfair told Agence France-Presse Thursday they were “all very worried” by new restrictions and feared the return of Soviet-like censorship.Agence France-Presse reports:Since president Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine on February 24, Russian authorities have strengthened controls on the flow of information, including in the arts.Last week, lawmakers approved a bill banning all forms of LGBTQ “propaganda” in books, films, the media and the internet.Authorities also want to ban the sale to minors of books written by “foreign agents” - a label given to Kremlin critics and activists, but also to a growing number of writers.Leading novelists like science fiction writerDmitry Glukhovskyand historical fiction novelistBoris Akuninhave been slapped with the tag, which has Stalin-era connotations.At the “Non/Fiction” book fair in Moscow - an important annual cultural event in the Russian capital that opened Thursday - many publishers, booksellers and readers were concerned.Yevgeny Kopyov,of the large Eksmo publishing house, said he was worried by the “broad interpretation” of the LGBTQ propaganda law.He warned that it “may affect a large amount of literature, including the classics,” adding, “Everything will depend on our interaction with the regulatory authorities.”Many publishers like Kopyov are waiting for authorities to clarify what they believe is LGBTQ “propaganda” or not.But some bookstores in Saint Petersburg already got rid of problematic books by offering discounts of up to 50 percent, according to local media.At the Non/Fiction fair,Marina Kadetovaof the Kompas-Gid publishing house, warned that the restrictions are fuelling “self-censorship.”“When people start censoring themselves, then the problems start,” she said, adding, “In any restrictions that are not justified and not thought through, it is hard to work.”Tatiana Stoyanova,who also works at the same publishers, said the restrictions could lead to a revival of the Soviet “samizdat” practise that saw the underground publishing of banned books.“In Russia, there is such a mentality: the more its forbidden, the more it’s interesting,” she said.7.24pmGMTUS president Joe Biden said he has no immediate plans to contact Russian president Vladimir Putin but is prepared to speak with him if he shows an interest in ending the war in Ukraine, and only in consultation with NATO allies.“I have no immediate plans to contact Mr Putin,” Biden said at a White House news conference after talks with French presidentEmmanuel Macron, Reuters reports.“I’m prepared to speak with Mr. Putin, if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn’t done that yet.”6.59pmGMTMacron: 'we will never force Ukrainians into a compromise'Biden and Macron are asked about Republican dissenters about money being sent to support the Ukrainian war effort.Macron responds. Speaking in English, he says: “Look I do thank president and his administration for his great commitment they have vis a vis Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.“Let me just say that our two nations are made of values and a history. What is at stake in Ukraine is now just very far from here, in a small country, somewhere in Europe. But it is about our values. It is about our principles. And it is about what we agreed together in the UN charter, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. That’s why I do believe that the US strongly supporting Ukraine in that time is very important, not just for the Ukrainians but also for the Europeans, but for the stability of our world today.“If we consider that we can abandon a country, and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means there is no possible stability in this world. I think it is important to have you so much committed.“We will follow up our own support. We increased our military support, our humanitarian support and our economic support.”He goes on to add that he will not try to strongarm the government in Kyiv into agreeing a settlement they are unhappy with.“We will never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise that will never be acceptable to them. They are so brave, and they defend precisely their lives and nations and our principles. It will never build a sustainable peace if we want a sustainable peace. We have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions which they will negotiate their territory and their future.”6.35pmGMTEmmanuel Macron is now responding to Joe Biden’s comments.Macron said that France led the diplomatic effort to avoid Russia’s invasion in February. “We clearly condemn this war, immediately,” he says.“We support both the Ukrainian army that is resisting and the Ukrainian population.”He thanks the US for its support, saying that it is affecting Europe directly and recognises the money the US has sent as part of the war effort.“The war effort is targeting the civilian infrastructure, bringing even more violence to make the Ukrainian people desperate and make it difficult for them to survive this winter,” the French president said.Macron said the allies are committed to the UN charter, and helping rebuild Ukraine after the war and a “sustainable peace”.6.25pmGMTBiden: 'I didn't anticipate Russia being as brutal as they have been'Joe Biden has told the press conference that the US stands with its allies “as strong as ever” against Russia’s “brutal war” against Ukraine.Biden said the support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he adds has been “incredibly brutal”. He adds: “I knew Russia was [brutal], but I didn’t anticipate them being as brutal as they have been.”“Today we reaffirm that we are going to stand together against this brutality. We will continue this strong support for the Ukrainian people as they defend their homes, their families, hospitals, their nurseries, their sovereignty, their integrity, against Russian aggression.”He adds that France has welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, and Biden thanks them for doing so.“Attacking civilian infrastructure, choking off energy to Europe to drive up prices, exacerbating the food crisis. That is hurting very vulnerable people not just in Ukraine but around the world. But he won’t succeed.“We will work together to hold Russia accountable for their actions, and to mitigate the global impacts of Putin’s war on the rest of the world.”The US president says that the country is helping Europe with its energy security and that a new deal has been agreed with France on civil nuclear power.6.15pmGMTRussia must be held accountable for war crimes say Biden and MacronJoe Biden and Emmanuel Macron are set to give a press conference shortly, as part of the French president’s official visit to the White House.They have issued this statement beforehand, after a meeting between the two presidents earlier on Thursday.The main part is that they say that Russia is carrying out war crimes and that they should be held responsible.The presidents strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.They also condemn and reject Russia’s illegal attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international law. The United States and France deplore Russia’s deliberate escalatory steps, notably its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its disinformation regarding alleged chemical attacks, and biological and nuclear weapons programs.They reaffirm their nations’ continued support for Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including the provision of political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine for as long as it takes.This includes the provision of significant resources to support Ukrainian civilian resilience through the winter, including stepping up the delivery of air defense systems and equipment needed to repair Ukraine’s energy grid. The United States and France plan to continue working with partners and allies to coordinate assistance efforts, including at the international conference taking place in Paris on 13 December 2022.They also intend to continue providing robust direct budget support for Ukraine, and to urge the international financial institutions to scale up their financial support.The United States and France reiterate their duty to uphold applicable international obligations and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. They also reiterate their steadfast resolve to hold Russia to account for widely documented atrocities and war crimes, committed both by its regular armed forces and by its proxies, including mercenary entities such as Wagner and others, through support for international accountability mechanisms, including the international criminal court, the Ukrainian prosecutor general, UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry, and the OSCE Moscow Mechanism, sanctions, and other means.The United States and France remain committed to addressing the wider effects of Russia’s war, including working with the international community to build greater resilience to food and energy disruptions.Updatedat 6.37pm GMT6.10pmGMTEU members are close to agreeing a $60 dollar per barrel price cap on Russian oil, diplomats said Thursday, with just Poland left to give the final nod, Agency France-Presse reports.Europe will begin enforcing an embargo on Russian crude shipments from Monday, so the price cap will apply to oil exported by sea by Moscow to ports around the world.Measures will be taken to prevent tankers from shipping Russian oil sold above this price, for example by refusing to allow British and EU insurers to cover vessels and shipments.The EU was already in agreement with Washington on the need to cap the price western clients pay for Russia’s oil, to prevent Moscow profiting from price rises triggered by its own war on Ukraine.The European Commission had suggested the ceiling along with an order that if the trading price of oil falls below $60 then the cap will be cut until it is 5% lower than the market. Poland had been pushing for it to be even lower at $30.5.04pmGMTThe British adventurist and TV personality Bear Grylls has become the latest celebrity to meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv.Grylls posted pictures with Zelenskiyon his Instagram on Thursday afternoon. He wrote that he wanted to know how Zelenskiy was coping for an upcoming programme “but got so much more.”“Through this special programme the world will see a side to president Zelenskiy that has never been shown before.”Word started spreading that Grylls was in Ukraine on Wednesdaywhen he was photographedfilming at a Ukrainian petrol station.Grylls also posed for pictures on a train with the staff of Ukraine’s state railway companyposted on Thursday.Ukraine has not had commercial flights since the invasion.Sean Penn, Ben Stiller and Richard Branson are among other celebrities who have been hosted by Ukraine’s president in Kyiv since the start of the invasion.5.02pmGMTThe UK-based Royal United Services Institute defence and security thinktank published a paper on Wednesday that examined the early days of the Russian invasion in February.A few snippetsfrom the report’s executive summary. It believes that a Ukrainian victory is possible, but “it requires significant heavy fighting”.The paper says that according to operational data from the Ukrainian general staff, Russia had a 12:1 advantage over the Ukrainian forces north of Kyiv in the immediate aftermath of the invasion.The paper’s four authors said that the plan was to invade Ukraine over a 10 day period, which would have led to a full annexation by August 2022. It hoped to draw defending forces away from the capital, enabling a swift capture.However it goes on to say: “The very operational security that enabled the successful deception, however, also led Russian forces to be unprepared at the tactical level to execute the plan effectively.“The Russian plan’s greatest deficiency was the lack of reversionary courses of action. As a result, when speed failed to produce the desired results, Russian forces found their positions steadily degraded as Ukraine mobilised.”It also claims that Russia planned to arrested and execute those involved in the 2014 Maidan revolution, which led to the resignation of pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych.Rusi’s paper says that Russia underperformed tactically compared to expectations, and it was only superior weapons systems and Ukrainian troops using up their ammunition supply that has led to relative Russian successes.The paper also paints a chaotic behind-the-scenes operation for Kremlin troops. It says the Russian army “are culturally averse to providing those who are executing orders with the context to exercise judgement”.It also has lessons for UK and US forces. It says that it is only because of two artillery brigades that Ukrainian forces prevented Kyiv being captured, and initially it was able to match the resources of the Russians. However this has since shifted starkly in favour of Russia, and that the imbalance “must be rectified if deterrence is credible and is equally a problem for the [British] RAF and Royal Navy.”4.26pmGMTMore than1,300 prisoners returned to Ukraine since Russia invadedMore than 1,300 prisoners have been returned to Ukraine since Russian troops invaded, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday.Zelenskiy was speaking after a new exchange of 50 prisoners with Russian and pro-Russian forces.“After today’s exchange, there are already 1,319 heroes who returned home,” Zelenskiy said on Instagram,posting a photoshowing a few dozen men holding Ukrainian flags.“We will not stop until we get all our people back,” the Ukrainian leader said.Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the 50 returning Ukrainians included those who had defended Mariupol and Azovstal.In a meeting with the Red Cross in October Russia said it held about 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war.Updatedat 5.23pm GMT4.14pmGMTThe head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was too early reach a verdict on talks between Poland and Germany about sending the Patriot air-defence systems from Germany to Ukraine.“We all agree on the urgent need to help Ukraine, including with air defence systems,” Stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz.However, he added, “it is important to understand that this is not only about delivering new systems but ensuring the systems that are being delivered can operate,” Reuters reports, including having enough ammunition, spare parts and maintenance.4.02pmGMTSummary of the day so farThe time in Kyiv has just gone 6pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far:Ukraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on the main frontline in the south.The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Ukrainian officials also stressed thatRussiahad intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river.An investigation is under way into a suspected letter bomb sent to the US embassy in Madrid.It would be the sixth after five were sent to the Ukrainian embassy, Spanish politicians, a Spanish airbase and a company that makes rocket launchers on Wednesday.

Lavrov said that the US was trying to break up Russia, and that it was “naive” to think talks could take place while this happened.Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said.The statement was published a day afterRussiasaid it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine.The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has urged China’s top leaders to use their influence over Russia to end the war inUkraine.Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, held talks with Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, in the first face-to-face encounter between the head of an EU institution and China’s top officials since the start of the pandemic.Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has said thatEuropeshould go back to its prewar “peace order” with Russiaif Russian president Vladimir Putin will renounce aggression against his neighbours, according toa report in the Timesof his comments at a security conference in Berlin.The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) forUkraineon Wednesday, the Pentagon said.The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks.Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine inUkraineas a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past.In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide.Another PoW exchange will take place later on Thursday between Russia andUkraine.Fifty prisoners of war will be handed over in the latest swap between the two sides.The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as theUkrainewar and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine.The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago.France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials –potentially includingVladimir Putin–for the crime of aggression in Ukraine.Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south,the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the EU to include Russia’s missile industry in its next sanctions package.Kuleba says it is warranted for their part in Russia’s war efforts, including those which have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure.Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia,foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue.

Russia spoilt the peace order we worked on for so many decades and we agreed there should never again be the attempt to change borders by force.“And what Russia is doing today is going back to the imperialistic approach of the 19th, 18th, 17th century where just a stronger country thinks it could just take the territory of the neighbour, understanding neighbours as just hinterland, and some place they can give rules to be followed. And this can never be accepted.”However, he continued: “We have to go back to the agreements which we had in the last decades and which were the basis for peace and security order in Europe.“And for Russia this also means that it accepts that there are open-minded societies, open societies, democracies, that follow completely a different way of how they are governed and how they attract people ... In the end there is no aggression coming from the member states of the European Union, there is no aggression coming from Nato, and all questions of common security could be solved and discussed. There is a willingness to do so.“We can come back to a peace order that worked and make it safe again if there is a willingness in Russia to go back to this peace order.”Updatedat 3.56pm GMT3.21pmGMTThis is from our correspondents in Kyiv,Isobel Koshiw,and Brussels,Jennifer Rankin,on France backing the creation of a tribunal to try officials for crimes of aggression in Ukraine.France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try top Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine.The French foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was working with its European partners on the proposal. The statement came after the European Union, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, lent support for the tribunal in a speech on the bloc’s plans for Ukraine.The defendants of such a tribunal would be those with decision-making power involved in committing the crime of aggression, meaning the transgression of Ukraine’s borders by the Russian military. This would very likely mean just a handful of figures, including Putin as well as other figures such as the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu.If they were convicted, even in absentia, the sentence would set in stone current relations with Russia by labelling Putin and his team international criminals and make sitting down at the negotiating table nearly impossible.Read more:Related:France backs plans for tribunal for Russian officials over Ukraine warUpdatedat 3.56pm GMT2.53pmGMTA Ukrainian artilleryman carries empty cartridges from 152 mm 2S3 Akatsiya (self-propelled howitzer) in a field near an undisclosed frontline position in eastern Ukraine yesterday.2.34pmGMTRussia has pulled back forces from towns opposite Kherson, says UkraineUkraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on what is now the main frontline in the south.The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Ukrainian officials also stressed that Russia had intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river.Since Russia abandoned Kherson last month, nine months into its invasion of Ukraine, the river now forms the entire southern stretch of the front, Reuters reported.Russia has already told civilians to leave towns within 15 km of the river and withdrawn its civilian administration from the city of Nova Kakhovka on the bank. Ukrainian officials have previously said Russia pulled back some artillery near the river to safer positions further away, but until now had stopped short of saying Russian forces were quitting towns.“A decrease in the number of Russian soldiers and military equipment is observed in the settlement of Oleshky,” the military said, referring to the town opposite Kherson city, on the far side of a destroyed bridge over the Dnipro.“Enemy troops were withdrawn from certain settlements of the Kherson oblast and dispersed in forest strips along the section of the Oleshky - Hola Prystan highway,” it said, referring to a 25-km (15-mile) stretch of road through riverside towns scattered in woods on the bank opposite Kherson city.It said most of the Russian troops in the area were recently mobilised reservists, suggesting that Moscow’s best-trained professional troops had already left. Reuters could not independently confirm the report.Updatedat 2.38pm GMT2.12pmGMTRussia’s foreign minister has accused the west of becoming directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine by supplying it with weapons and training its soldiers.Sergei Lavrov also said thatRussia’s strikes on Ukrainian energy facilitiesand other key infrastructure that have left millions without power, heating and water were intended to weaken Ukraine’s military potential and derail the shipments of western weapons, the Associated Press reported.“You shouldn’t say that the US and Nato aren’t taking part in this war, you are directly participating in it,” Lavrov said in a video call with reporters.“And not just by providing weapons but also by training personnel. You are training their military on your territory, on the territories of Britain, Germany, Italy and other countries.”He said that thebarrage of Russian missile strikeswas intended to “knock out energy facilities that allow you to keep pump",2,
The Guardian,Three lawmakers who sheltered during Capitol attack test positive for Covid,"Three lawmakers who had to shelter for safety during the US Capitol riot have tested positive for Covid-19.Related:‘Health insurance or food’: Americans face difficult choices amid pandemicPramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, announced her positive result early on Tuesday, while chastising Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks while they waited in a secured room for more than five hours.The New Jersey representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, also a Democrat, said she decided to get tested because of the possibility of exposure and tested positive. She also tweeted that she was receiving monoclonal antibody treatment – which is still being investigated – on the advice of her doctor. Coleman, 75, is a cancer survivor.Later on Tuesday, Brad Schneider, another Democrat, from Illinois, announced he too had tested positive. “Today, I am now in strict isolation, worried that I have risked my wife’s health and angry at the selfishness and arrogance of the anti-maskers who put their own contempt and disregard for decency ahead of the health and safety of their colleagues and our staff,” he said in a statement on hiswebsite.Dr Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress, hadadvisedrepresentatives and staff on Sunday that those in the secured room could have “been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection”.I just received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one.https://t.co/wVmgroKsdf— Rep.

More than 376,000 people have died in the US since the pandemic started last year.As hospitalstry to fitoverflowing patients into gift shops and chapels, public health officials are trying to rev up vaccine distribution.The Trump administration announced on Tuesday it would expand eligibility criteria for the vaccine to everyone above 65, rather than limiting the vaccine to essential workers and other specific groups.In California, where 30,000 people have now died, the Disneyland resort is set to become a “super” Covid-19 vaccine site for Orange county, home to 3 million residents. In Florida, some counties are using the Eventbrite website – normally used for concerts or recreation – to sign people up for shots.Just days from the presidential inauguration, many are waiting to see if Joe Biden’s coronavirus taskforce can make up for lost time in the rocky vaccine rollout.The president-elect announced his team wouldrelease and distributeas many vaccines as possible when in power, which some critics say could delay the second round needed for maximum efficacy.Political infighting over the virus does not seem to be going away with the Trump administration. Greene released a statement about her refusal to protect her colleagues last Wednesday.“Congresswoman Greene is a healthy adult who tested negative for Covid at the White House just this week,” it said.“She does not believe healthy Americans should be forced to muzzle themselves with a mask.

BBC News,Defiant Trump flies home after not guilty plea,"Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges alleging he retained classified documents after he left the White House It's alleged that US government secrets were stored in a shower, bathroom, ballroom and bedroom of his Mar-a-Lago estate After leaving the court, the former president stopped at a well-known Cuban cafe in Miami to greet supporters Trump will speak later today from his golf club in New Jersey Some supporters of the former president protested against the indictment outside the Miami court Trump, who is campaigning to win back the White House, says the indictment is ""election interference"" Special Counsel Jack Smith, the lead investigator, says he wants a speedy trial and that Trump is innocent until proven guilty Edited by Marianna Brady and Brandon Livesay How Trump's historic day in court unfolded - in 60 seconds That's a wrap for our live coverage of Donald Trump becoming the first former US president to be arraigned on federal charges. It was a day of drama and political intrigue, with perhaps the most significant moment taking place when Trump stood silently in court as his lawyer entered a plea of ""not guilty"" to the 37 counts against him. Our writers today were Brandon Drenon, Chelsea Bailey, Sam Cabral, Juan Benn, Victoria Lindrea, Charley Adams and Emily Atkinson.

Donald Trump turns 77 on Wednesday Trump then boarded his personal plane to head home to Bedminster, New Jersey, where he will hold a rally Now that the first former president in US history has been federally charged, it steers the country's political and judicial system into uncharted waters. Experts estimate it could be a year or longer before Trump's trial actually begins. The case is now in the hands of Florida federal judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee. Some pundits suspect Trump will attempt to delay the trial until 2024, under the assumption that he - the Republican party's leading 2024 presidential candidate - could win the presidency and thus be in a position to absolve himself of the charges. Cannon has been accused of ruling in favour of Trump in the past, leading some US media to liken Trump's case in her hands to ""winning the judicial lottery"". However, upon unsealing Trump's charges on Friday, special counsel Jack Smith said his office would seek a ""speedy trial"". But that decision will be out of Smith's hands. Donald Trump's plane has just touched down at Newark International Airport. He will now travel to Bedminister, New Jersey. We're expecting the former president to make a speech at 20:45 (local time). Donald Trump will soon be greeted by friends and fans at his luxury golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. A speech is planned for 20:45 (local time). His team has set up about 200 chairs outside the venue, with name cards on each seat for guests and overflow tables nearby. A familiar cast of Trump loyalists is expected to be present, including Mike Lindell, the business magnate known as the 'My Pillow Guy'; Ed Cox, the New York Republican Party chairman; and Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville. They'll look on as Trump makes his scheduled address on today's events and attempts to spin his federal charges into fundraising gold. The former president, who is running for office again, is expected to hold a  private fundraiser after the announcement, where he reportedly hopes to raise at least $2m (Â£1.5m). A fundraising email from Trump's campaign was sent out about 30 minutes ago which started off with the words: ""Iâm writing you this email as I fly back from the Miami federal courthouse where I was ARRAIGNED as an INNOCENT MAN."" Donald Trump was arraigned in a federal court in Miami, marking the first time in US history a former president has been federally prosecuted. Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House I've just left another event in which President Joe Biden spoke - this time to a gathering of ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions. As Biden walked off, one of the reporters here yelled out - asking if he would comment on Trump's court appearance in Florida. While some coverage had hinted at the possibility of mass rallies by Trump supporters in Miami today, the crowd outside the court turned out to be fairly small. A few users on a pro-Trump online forum, which was used to organise the January 2021 Capitol riots, spoke of disappointment over the ""dismal showing"". But the small crowd is consistent with general chatter on pro-Trump online circles prior to today's hearing. The aftermath of the Capitol riots, which resulted in more than 1,000 arrests and several heavy prison sentences, has changed the way Trump supporters respond to what they say is unjust targeting of the former president. There's fear and paranoia. Some of the far-right militia and conspiracy movements that were involved - like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys - have seen their leading figures detained and jailed, leaving them with far less power and influence. It will take something far more consequential for the former president's fans to once again put themselves on the frontline, as they did two years ago. Donald
Trump has the support of millions of mainstream Republicans, but some of those who turned
out to protest in Miami appear to be a fringe subset of fans. A flag bearing
the logo of conspiracy website Infowars flew over the protesters as Laura Loomer livestreamed on Twitter. Loomer is a failed hard-right congressional candidate known for performing stunts targeting politicians and social media companies. Also broadcasting from the scene was Anthime Gionet, better known by his nickname
""Baked Alaska"", a white nationalist influencer whoearlier this year was sentenced to two months in prisonfor unlawfully demonstrating during
the January 2021 Capitol riots. Members of
the Proud Boys and QAnon believers - some wearing clothing referencingthe sprawling conspiracy theory- were also spotted in the crowd. There were
more conventional figures as well. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican presidential
candidate, made a speech pledging that if he's elected president, he'll pardon Trump. Coutroom sketches have just been published that show former president Donald Trump. Another sketch shows his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, surrounded by a legal team. The drawings give us a glimpse inside the historic court proceeding, where cameras were not allowed. Madeline HalpertReporting from court in Miami, Florida Sitting in the court overflow room alongside a dozen other reporters, I was able to watch a video of the arraignment proceedings with a front-row seat to Trump and Nautaâs expressions. Both seemed relatively subdued during the entire process, looking straight ahead or staring down. Trump occasionally stopped to twiddle his thumbs or cross his arms over his chest, hunched over. He seemed similarly downcast as he was during his first arraignment in New York, on charges he falsified business records, in April. Nauta seemed to look down with his arms at his sides for the whole arraignment process. 

Neither spoke during the hearing, nor did they look at one another. Earlier, we incorrectly reported Walt Nauta had entered a plea of not guilty on the conspiracy charge. We have removed that post. Now we have more information from reporters, we can clarify that Trump's aide did not enter a plea. His arraignment was in fact postponed until 27 June over legal technicalities. Although he had attorneys representing him, it was determined Nauta also needed a Florida lawyer in order to enter a plea. Throughout the hearing, Nauta was seated to the right of his employer and co-defendant, Donald Trump. Kayla EpsteinReporting from court in Miami, Florida The press spent hours seated in a jury room, waiting for news of whether we would get in. We were checked multiple times by US marshals and secret service, then sent to a large courtroom. There were no phones, laptops, or recording devices allowed inside the building or courtroom. 

When we walked in, Trump was already there, seated on the right-hand side and flanked by his defence attorneys. The first thing I saw walking in was his shock of straw-coloured hair, illuminated by overhead lights. Trump looked stony and said little except whispered asides to his attorneys. He shifted in his seat throughout the proceedings but otherwise appeared calm. 

When asked to enter Trumpâs plea, his attorney Todd Blanche said: âWe most certainly enter a plea of not guilty.â Trumpâs assistant-turned-co-defendant Walt Nauta was seated at the same table, but Trump barely looked at him throughout the proceedings. When court adjourned, Trump walked out of court flanked by his security details. The reporters immediately sprinted to a lift and we crammed ourselves in to be able to get back to file. We then ran out of the courthouse to retrieve our phones and send our reports - like the one youâre reading now. Donald Trump is now about to leave Miami on his private plane - dubbed ""Trump Force One"". He's headed to his luxury golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he's expected to make a public address on today's criminal proceedings at 20:15 (00:15 GMT). Inside Donald Trump's airplane dubbed 'Trump Force One' Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent Trump surprises guests in Cuban restaurant Donald Trumpâs indictment played out in two courts on Tuesday afternoon - a federal courtroom in Miami and the court of public opinion. Inside the Miami courthouse, Trump and his legal team were demure. One of Trumpâs lawyers told the presiding judge that the former president was pleading not guilty to all charges. There was some back-and-forth over what kind of contact Trump could have with his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, and with potential witnesses in his case. The former president was released without any restrictions on his travel. Outside the courthouse, and on social media, it was a very different scene. Throughout the day, the former president posted to his Truth Social website, insulting Special Counsel Jack Smith and questioning why he wasnât investigating alleged crimes by Democrats. âOne of the saddest days in the history of our country,â he wrote. âWe are a nation in decline!!!â Thatâs standard rhetorical fair for Trump, who tends to launch his fiercest attacks when he feels the most threatened. The other message Trump sent following his arraignment was a more subtle political one. His motorcade stopped at Versailles, a Cuban restaurant and bakery popular with residents of the Little Havana neighbourhood and tourists alike. While there, he shook hands, took pictures and made brief remarks, as patrons serenaded the soon-to-be 77-year-old former president with a rendition of Happy Birthday. It looked and felt like a typical meet-and-greet for a campaigning politician in a key battleground state. It was a visible sign that, for Trump, his bid for the White House is moving forward, indictments be damned. Diners sing happy birthday to Donald Trump Trump's motorcade has stopped at Cafe Versailles, a famous Cuban restaurant in Little Havana. Cell phones flew into the air as the former president stood among his fans, smiling for the slew of selfies. Trump told the owner ""food for everyone"" and then the crowd burst into a rendition of happy birthday to the former president, who turns 77 tomorrow. Alexandra OstasiewiczReporting from Miami, Florida Tempers are running hot outside the courthouse. Earlier, a short verbal confrontation between a Trump supporter and a counter-protester drew a crowd of spectators. Advocates for the former president are in the majority here, but anti-Trump protesters, a vocal minority, are carrying signs with phrases like âlock him upâ. Protester jumps in front of Trump's motorcade There were no barriers between the pavements and SUVs as Trump's motorcade exited the courthouse. One protester lunged into the street towards the motorcade, but was quickly dragged away by officials, ending a brief moment of chaos. Donald Trump's extensive motorcade is now on its way to the airport. The Miami court hearing has officially ended. Donald Trump heard the charges against him and pleaded not guilty to each of the 37 counts. He will now make his way back to his luxury golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman has told former president Donald Trump and his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, not to discuss the facts of the case between themselves. The judge said he recognised the two worked together, but any conversations about the case must go through their lawyers, he said. Nauta serves as Trump's so-called ""body-man"" or personal valet and works closely with the president on a daily basis.",0,

BBC News,Israeli PM warns Hamas over two Israelis 'held in Gaza',"Israel's prime minister says he holds Hamas responsible for the fate of two Israeli citizens believed held in Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was working to secure their safe return. Israel said it believes one, an Ethiopian Israeli, was being held by Hamas. An Israeli Arab is also being held in Gaza, defence officials say. Hamas has not commented on either case. The group held an Israeli soldier for five years before being exchanging him for hundreds of prisoners in 2011. The Islamist militant group has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006. It reinforced its power there in 2007 after ousting its political rivals, Fatah. Israeli defence officials say Avraham Mangisto, of Ethiopian origin, went into the Palestinian territory of his own accord last September and has been missing since then. Israel says it has appealed to international and regional bodies to help clarify Mr Mangisto's situation and are demanding his immediate release. ""According to credible intelligence, Mangisto is being held against his will by Hamas,"" a defence ministry statement said. ""Israel will continue to pursue the release and return of  the citizen to Israel,"" it added. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said it was a ""painful situation"" and that he was in contact with Mr Mangisto's family. ""This is a humanitarian issue, and we expect those holding him to behave accordingly and return him in good health,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu called on the international community to help secure the men's release. ""I expect the international community, which expresses its concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, to issue a clear call for these citizens to be released and to see to their return,"" he said. The Associated Press quoted an unnamed official as saying it was unclear why Mr Mangisto went into Gaza but that he was believed to be mentally unstable. Israeli media said the 28-year-old, from Ashkelon, had breached the heavily-guarded security fence between Israel and Gaza. Local media said the Israeli Arab being held in Gaza was a Bedouin from Israel's southern Negev desert. His name has not been released. The defence ministry said he had crossed into Gaza several times before. The two cases were cleared for publication on Thursday after a court lifted a gagging order. In 2006, Sgt Shalit was captured in a cross-border raid by Hamas, triggering a crisis which was only resolved years later in a controversial exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",2,
The Guardian,Senate votes to acquit as Trump celebrates: our movement 'has only just begun' – as it happened,"12.33amGMTDonald Trump's second acquittal summaryThat’s it from me tonight, after a historic day in Washington. Here’s how the second impeachment trial ofDonald Trumpcame to a close today:The Senate voted to acquit Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in a vote of 57-43.The decision came a little over a month after the president incited a group of his supporters to stage a violent insurrection at the US Capitol, resulting in five deaths.Seven Senate Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in supporting Trump’s conviction.Republican SenatorsRichard Burrof North Carolina,Bill Cassidyof Louisiana,Susan Collinsof Maine,Lisa Murkowskiof Alaska,Mitt Romneyof Utah,Ben Sasseof NebrakaandPat Toomeyof Pennsylvania voted to find Trump guilty of incitement of insurrection. Although the former president was still acquitted, this marked the most bipartisan impeachment vote in Senate history.The trial came to a swift end after House impeachment managers reversed their decision to call witnesses.The Senate approved a resolution to allow the managers to request witness testimony, but the managers eventually decided to instead just admit a statement from congresswomanJaime Herrera Beutlerto the official trial record rather than calling any witnesses. After the statement was accepted, the trial moved on to closing arguments and the final vote.Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer expressed dismay over the vote to acquit Trump.The Democratic leader urged Americans to never forget the violence and destruction of the Capitol insurrection. “My fellow Americans: remember that day, January 6th, forever — the final, terrible legacy of the 45th president of the United States and undoubtedly our worst,” Schumer said. “Let it live on in infamy, a stain on Donald John Trump that can never, never be washed away.”Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell directly blamed Trump for the insurrection, even though he voted to acquit the former president.“There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically, and morally, responsible for provoking the events of the day,” McConnell said in a floor speech after the vote. But the Republican leader argued he could not support conviction because it was not appropriate to hold an impeachment trial for a president who had already left office. McConnell interestingly suggested it was still possible for Trump to be held criminally responsible for the insurrection.Thanks for following along with our impeachment trial coverage tonight. Tune back in tomorrow, when the live blog will cover more fallout from the acquittal vote.12.11amGMTTJ Duckloconfirmed in his own statement that he has offered his resignation as deputy press secretary forJoe Biden.Ducklo expressed regret over threatening a White House reporter who raised questions about his romantic relationship with another journalist.“I know this was terrible.

This conversation occurred with the support of the White House Chief of Staff,” Psaki said in a statement.“We are committed to striving every day to meet the standard set by the President in treating others with dignity and respect, with civility and with a value for others through our words and our actions.”The statement comes a day afterVanity Fair reportedthat Ducklo made insulting and threatening comments to a reporter who posed questions about his romantic relationship with another journalist. The White House announced yesterday that Ducklo would be suspended for one week.Updatedat 12.13am GMT11.57pmGMTDonald Trumphas reportedly voiced concern that he may be held criminally responsible for the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.CNNreports:Trump has privately voiced concern in the last two weeks about whether he could face charges as a result of the January 6 riot he’s accused of inciting, according to multiple people.Trump has mainly been quiet since leaving the White House last month, and his silence has been in part related to those concerns.‘He’s worried about it,’ one adviser close to Trump told CNN.Senate minority leaderMitch McConnellraised the possibility that Trump could face criminal consequences for inciting the insurrection, after he voted to acquit Trump in the impeachment trial.“President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he’s in office,” McConnell said in a floor speech after the acquittal vote. “He didn’t get away with anything yet.”11.43pmGMTLouisiana GOP censures Cassidy over conviction voteThe executive committee of the Republican party of Louisiana has unanimously decided to censure SenatorBill Cassidyover his vote to convictDonald Trumpof incitement of insurrection.The state party said in an earlier statement, “We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the vote today by Sen.

It is instead about President Trump’s failure to obey the oath he swore on January 20, 2017,” Collins said in a floor speech.“His actions to interfere with the peaceful transition of power – the hallmark of our constitution and our American democracy – were an abuse of power and constitute grounds for conviction.”Sen.

The abuse of power and betrayal of his oath by President Trump meet the constitutional standard of ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ and for those reasons I voted to convict Donald J. Trump.”11.14pmGMTFox News seemed to suggest theRepublicanswho supported convictingDonald Trumphad betrayed their voters, saying in a news alert that the seven senators “turned their backs” on the former president.Actual Fox News alert I just received.pic.twitter.com/LuJAVNr6Fv— David French (@DavidAFrench)February 13, 2021The Republican senators who supported conviction have said they made their votes based on a desire to protect the constitution and hold Trump accountable for inciting the Capitol insurrection.11.03pmGMTSenatorLisa Murkowskiwas one of the sevenRepublicanswho voted to convictDonald Trumpin the impeachment trial. Of those seven Republicans, Murkowski is the only one who is up for reelection next year.Murkowski said in an interview that she felt it was important for her to stand up for her values with this vote.“If I can’t say what I believe that our president should stand for, then why should I ask Alaskans to stand with me?” Murkowskitold Politico.“This was consequential on many levels, but I cannot allow the significance of my vote, to be devalued by whether or not I feel that this is helpful for my political ambitions.”10.53pmGMTPelosi ridicules McConnell's 'pathetic' rationale for acquittalHouse speakerNancy Pelosiexpanded upon her thoughts onDonald Trump’s acquittal in a statement released by her office.“Donald Trump’s incitement of insurrection against our Democracy put Senators, Members of Congress, staff and heroic law enforcement officers in mortal danger,” the Democratic speaker said. “It is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president and is clearly deserving of conviction.”Pelosi applauded the Republican senators who voted to convict Trump, while condemning the 43Republicanswho allowed the former president to be acquitted.“I salute the Republican Senators who voted their conscience and for our Country,” Pelosi said. “Other Senate Republicans’ refusal to hold Trump accountable for igniting a violent insurrection to cling to power will go down as one of the darkest days and most dishonorable acts in our nation’s history.”It’s pathetic that@LeaderMcConnellkept the Senate shut down so that Article of Impeachment couldn’t be received & used that as his excuse for voting to acquit.https://t.co/HqLLKIGbwX— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi)February 13, 2021Pelosi specifically criticizedMitch McConnellfor arguing the impeachment trial was unconstitutional because Trump had already left office, when the then-majority leader refused to call the Senate back for an emergency session to start the trial in January.“It is so pathetic that Senator McConnell kept the Senate shut down so that the Senate could not receive the Article of Impeachment and has used that as his excuse for not voting to convict Donald Trump,” Pelosi said.“Tragically, Senate Republicans who voted not to convict chose to abandon the Constitution, the Country and the American people with this vote. Thank God for the judges and Republican elected officials across the country who pushed back against Donald Trump’s attempted overturning of our election which fueled the insurrection.”Updatedat 11.08pm GMT10.38pmGMTImpeachment managerJoaquin Castronoted that the SenateRepublicanswho voted to acquit did not attempt to defendDonald Trump’s actions on 6 January.Instead, Senate Republicans focused their arguments for acquittal on the idea that it is unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a president who has already left office.“The defendant, President Donald John Trump, was let off on a technicality,” Castro said.It’s worth noting that the Senate held two votes on the constitutionality of the impeachment trial. Both votes upheld the trial’s constitutionality, with severalRepublicansjoiningDemocratsto move forward with the proceedings.Updatedat 10.43pm GMT10.30pmGMTImpeachment managerStacey Plaskettsaid the House team chose not to call witnesses in part because it would have likely “required subpoenas and months of litigation”.Plaskett said that those who may have been able to testify toDonald Trump’s actions and mindset on 6 January were “not friendly” to the impeachment managers and were thus unlikely to willingly testify.Updatedat 10.43pm GMT10.25pmGMTLead impeachment managerJamie Raskinsaid the White House was not involved in the decision to abandon the effort to call witnesses in the impeachment trial.The Senate voted this morning to allow the impeachment managers to request witness testimony, but the managers instead chose to simply admit congresswomanJaime Herrera Beutler’s statement to the official record and move on to closing arguments.“I made the call,” Raskin said, adding that he “never spoke to anyone from the White House”.10.17pmGMTPelosi condemns 'cowardly' Republicans who voted to acquit TrumpHouse speakerNancy Pelosijoined the impeachment managers’ press conference and applauded the work they did in the trial over the past week.The Democratic speaker denounced the “cowardly group ofRepublicans”who refused to holdDonald Trumpaccountable for inciting the January 6 insurrection.Pelosi specifically criticized Senate minority leaderMitch McConnellfor refusing to call an emergency session to begin the impeachment trial and then using the trial’s delay as a reason to acquit Trump.The speaker also dismissed the possibility of issuing a censure against Trump over the January 6 insurrection, saying it would be an insufficient response.“We censure people for using stationery for the wrong purpose. We don’t censure people for inciting insurrection,” Pelosi said.Updatedat 10.33pm GMT10.05pmGMTLead impeachment managerJamie Raskindefended his team’s decision to not call any witnesses after the Senate approved a resolution allowing them to request witness testimony.Raskin noted that Senate minority leaderMitch McConnellacknowledged Trump was directly responsible for the 6 January insurrection.

In the second vote, sixRepublicansjoinedDemocratsin supporting the constitutionality of the trial.In his statement explaining his vote to convict, RepublicanRichard Burrnoted he did not agree with the outcome of that vote, but he accepted it.“When this process started, I believed that it was unconstitutional to impeach a president who was no longer in office. I still believe that to be the case,” Burr said.“However, the Senate is an institution based on precedent, and given that the majority in the Senate voted to proceed with this trial, the question of constitutionality is now established precedent. As an impartial juror, my role is now to determine whether House managers have sufficiently made the case for the article of impeachment against President Trump.”Burr went on to say, “The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a coequal branch of government and that the charge rises to the level of high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Therefore, I have voted to convict.”9.40pmGMTMcConnell suggests Trump could still be open to criminal prosecutionSenate minority leaderMitch McConnellsuggestedDonald Trumpmay still be open to criminal prosecution over his role in the January 6 insurrection.“President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he’s in office,” McConnell said. “He didn’t get away with anything yet.”The Republican leader noted that the US has both a criminal justice system and a civil litigation system, and he said former presidents are “not immune from being accountable by either one”.Of course, a potential criminal investigation would not have prevented the Senate from voting to convict Trump and block him from seeking federal office again.Updatedat 9.41pm GMT9.33pmGMTSenate minority leaderMitch McConnellalso argued that the chamber did not have the ability to convictDonald Trumpbecause he has already left office.It’s worth noting that the House impeached Trump while he was still in office, and Senate Democratic leaderChuck Schumercalled on McConnell, who was then the majority leader, to bring the chamber back for an emergency session to start the trial.McConnell refused to do so, delaying the trial until afterJoe Bidenwas sworn in.9.19pmGMTAfter voting to acquit, McConnell accuses Trump of 'disgraceful dereliction of duty'Senate minority leaderMitch McConnell,who voted to acquitDonald Trumpof incitement of insurrection, is now delivering a blistering speech about the former president.The Republican leader said Trump committed a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” by refusing to intervene as his supporters carried out a violent insurrection at the Capitol.“There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically, and morally, responsible for provoking the events of the day,” McConnell said.McConnell emphasized that the insurrectionists turned violent because Trump had told them a series of lies about the presidential election.“They did this because they’d been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth because he was angry he lost an election,” McConnell said. “This was an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories.”The Republican leader then pivoted to making a jurisdictional argument against conviction, saying the Senate is not meant to act as a “moral tribunal”.9.12pmGMTSchumer says January 6 should 'live on in infamy'Senate majority leaderChuck Schumerexpressed dismay over the vote to acquitDonald Trumpof incitement of insurrection.“He deserves to be convicted, and I believe he will be convicted in the court of public opinion,” Schumer said. “He deserves to be permanently discredited, and I believe he has been discredited in the eyes of the American people and in the judgment of history.”The Democratic leader commended the sevenRepublicanswho voted to convict Trump, resulting in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in Senate history.“I salute those Republican patriots who did the right thing. It wasn’t easy,” Schumer said.The majority leader then implored Americans to never forget the violence and destruction of the Capitol insurrection, which resulted in five deaths.“My fellow Americans, remember that day, January 6, forever,” Schumer said. “Let it live on in infamy.”Updatedat 12.18am GMT9.04pmGMTTrump revels in acquittal: our movement 'has only just begun'Donald Trumphas released a statement celebrating the Senate vote to acquit him of incitement of insurrection.“I want to first thank my team of dedicated lawyers and others for their tireless work upholding justice and defending truth,” the former president said.“My deepest thanks as well to all of the United States Senators and members of Congress who stood proudly for the constitution we all revere and for the sacred legal principles at the heart of our country.”Trump condemned the impeachment trial as “another phase of the greatest witch-hunt in the history of our country”, even though seven Republican senators voted to convict him.The former president also nodded at his political future now that he is free to run for the White House in 2024.“Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead, I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people.

He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.

""I believe President Trump acted against his oath of office, so I will vote to impeach him."" Upton shared a similar statement Tuesday evening, condemning the president's rhetoric and saying Congress must hold him ""to account and send a clear message that our county cannot and will not tolerate any effort by any president to impede the peaceful transfer of power from one president to the next. Katko, a former federal prosecutor, also shared a statement to Twitter Tuesday saying Trump ""encouraged"" the insurrection at the Capitol ""both on social media ahead of [Jan. 6] and in his speech that day,"" creating a ""combustible environment of misinformation, disenfranchisement and division.""

Fox News,Last US troops have departed Afghanistan,"Karen Vaughn and Jane Horton react to 13 service members killed in Afghanistan on 'The Story' The Pentagon announced Monday that all U.S. troops have departed Afghanistan. The final C-17 carrying service members lifted off from the Kabul airport at 3:29 pm U.S. Eastern Time. The removal of U.S. troops meets the Aug. 31 deadline the Biden administration agreed to with the Taliban, officially drawing the country's longest-ever conflict to an end. But the fate of those left behind remains a mystery, with White House Press Secretary Jen Psakiconfirming earlier Mondaythat a ""small number"" of Americans who want to leave remain in the country. Psaki could not give an estimate on exactly how many Americans remained in the country, though a senior State Department official put the number at ""below 250."" ""There’s a lot of heartbreak associated with this departure,"" CENTCOM Commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said of the closing down of evacuation operations. He acknowledged, ""We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out."" The general added that the ISIS threat to the operation was ""very real"" until the end, with ""overwhelming"" U.S. airpower circling overhead in an attempt to prevent further attacks. In addition to the people left behind in Kabul, McKenzie said the U.S. also left behind equipment such as the C-RAM (counter-artillery, artillery and mortar) system that was used to shoot down rockets, as well as dozens of armored Humvees and some aircraft. The general added that the equipment had been disabled and in the end none of it was mission capable. Michael Lee is a writer for Fox News.

The Guardian,Senior Republican who called Trump ‘inexcusable’ endorses him for president,"The No2 Republican in the US Senate, John Thune of South Dakota, endorsed for presidentDonald Trump– the man he previously called “inexcusable” for seeking to overturn the 2020 election and inciting the deadly January 6 attack on Congress.Related:The Michigan Republican party is already in chaos. What will Tuesday bring?Multiple media outlets reported Thune’s endorsement. They also swiftly pointed out statements made by Thune after the 2021 US Capitol attack, now linked to nine deaths, more than 1,200 arrests and hundreds of convictions, some for seditious conspiracy.“The impeachment trial is over and former President Trump has been acquitted,” Thunesaid on 13 February 2021, after only seven Republicans voted to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection and thereby bar him from office.“My vote to acquit should not be viewed as exoneration for his conduct on January 6 … or in the days and weeks leading up to it. What former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable.”Saying he voted to acquit because Trump had left office, and following his Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, who excoriated Trump after voting to acquit, Thune added: “I have faith in the American people and the strength of our democracy.”Many observers now hold democracy to be under serious threat as Trump homes in on the Republican nomination to face Joe Biden in November.Trump has won each primary vote, most recently in South Carolina on Saturday where he easily beat Nikki Haley, a former governor of the southern state and his only remaining opponent.Haley suffered a further blow on Sunday when the influential Koch network withdrew financial support, saying it would focus on Congress instead.“We don’t believe any outside group can make a material difference to widen her path to victory,” Emily Seidel, chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed advocacy group, told staff in a notereported by Politico.Trump’s dominance persists despite his facing 91 criminal charges (17 for election subversion, 40 for retention of classified information and 34 for hush-money payments to an adult film star) and civil judgments including multimillion-dollar penalties in suits over his business affairs and a defamation claim arising from a rape accusation a judge called substantially true.Such legal troubles have fueled doubts about Trump’s electability, shared by senior Republicans.Thune first endorsed Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator now pursuing selection as Trump’s nominee for vice-president. Trump oftenattackedThune in return.Fox Newsfirst reportedThune’s Trump endorsement.Thune said: “The primary results in South Carolina make clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president in this year’s pivotal presidential election. The choice before the American people is crystal clear: it’s Donald Trump or Joe Biden.“I support former President Trump’s campaign to win the presidency, and I intend to do everything I can to see that he has a Republican majority in the Senate working with him to restore American strength at home and abroad.”Of three senior Republicans thought to be possible successors to McConnell as leader in the Senate, Thune was the last to back Trump. John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas had already bent the knee.McConnell has not endorsed Trump, who has regularly attacked him – including calling him a “piece of shit” – and maderacist remarksabout his wife, Elaine Chao, who was US transportation secretary in the Trump administration until January 6, after which she resigned.Despite it all, the New York Timesreportedon Monday that aides to McConnell and Trump were pursuing “back channel” talks aimed at producing an endorsement.",1,
Fox News,Why are children less affected by coronavirus?,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.Sign up here. One mystery that scientists are still unpacking is why children are less impacted by thecoronaviruspandemic than adults. For the most part, children make up a very small percentage of the overall infected population; when they do have the disease, their symptoms tend to be mild. ""Not only are fewer children testing positive for COVID 19, but those that do test positive are likely to have milder cases,"" according to Priya Soni, a doctor and pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. That's not how most viruses have worked historically. 'DEVASTATINGLY' EFFECTIVE CORONAVIRUS CAPTURED IN IMAGE OF CELL Children seem to not be as impacted by COVID-19 as adults. (Getty Images)(Getty Images) SCIENTISTS REVEAL THE BEST MATERIALS FOR MAKING YOUR OWN MASK ""There is no other respiratory virus that we know, that affects adults so much more severely than infants,"" Soni said in a pressrelease. ""For example, when a child gets a viral infection there are usually more intense symptoms, accompanied by high fevers. In the case of COVID- 19, it's the adults who are getting the high fevers, having severe complications and even dying."" There are a few theories for why this might be. One is that since children have young immune systems, they don't develop the aggressive immune response known as a ""cytokine storm"" like adults do, which fosters lung damage and often harms adults. Meanwhile, researchers at Boston Children's Hospital on Tuesday announced a new two-pronged study of children and young adults up to age 25 to examine a wide range of factors that may promote vulnerability in COVID-19. ""Our major goals are to understand why some children get very ill with COVID-19 and why most children aren't getting sick in the same numbers as adults,"" said Adrienne Randolph, a senior physician in Critical Care Medicine at Boston Children's and the study's principal investigator. CORONAVIRUS LINGERS IN THE AIR OF CROWDED SPACES, NEW STUDY FINDS ""Based on what we know about other viruses, such as influenza, we would expect children to be the first to get sick and have more severe disease. If we can understand what protects kids, we may get clues as to why older people are so susceptible,"" Randolph said in astatement. The study -- backed by $2.1 million in funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- will perform real-time surveillance at more than 35 U.S. children's hospitals to capture data on 800 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, it will enroll up to 400 of these patients for detailed, prospective observation and periodic collection of respiratory and blood samples. As of Tuesday afternoon, the novel coronavirus had infected more than 1 million people in the U.S., and at least 57,266 people have died from the disease.",3,
Fox News,COVID-19: 99% of hospital admissions were among those not fully vaccinated,"Biden expected to unveil new coronavirus plan. Harvard Medical School’s Martin Kulldorff with reaction on 'Fox & Friends First.' They are the new 99 percenters: The vast majority of Americans who are getting serious cases ofCOVID-19or dying are unvaccinated. While COVID-19casescontinue to spike across the US, the overwhelming majority of deaths and hospitalizations from the virus continue to overwhelmingly be among unvaccinated Americans, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 30, about 99 percent of hospital admissions were among those who hadn’t been fully inoculated, which is defined by the CDC as two weeks after the second dose of aPfizer or Moderna vaccineor two weeks after Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose jab. As of Aug. 30, a little over 1.6 million Americans were hospitalized with COVID-19 — but only about 0.65 percent of them, or 10,471 patients, were fully vaccinated, the CDC data show.

(AP Photo/Kyle Green)(AP Photo/Kyle Green)) FAUCI ON COVID-19: US LACKING ‘MODESTLY GOOD CONTROL’ OVER PANDEMIC The numbers highlight the vaccine’s effectiveness in warding off serious cases of the virus, even as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the country, and the same pattern presents itself when analyzing COVID-19 deaths. In the same time period, about 99 percent of the people who lost their lives to COVID-19 were not fully inoculated against the virus, numbers published by the CDC show. Only 2,437 Americans, or 0.92 percent of deaths, were a result of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated patients. Health experts say breakthrough infections are expected and are becoming increasingly common with the appearance of new variants but that only a minuscule amount are resulting in serious cases, which indicates the vaccine is doing its intended job. As of Aug. 30, more than 173 million people have been fully vaccinated and just 0.01 percent of them, or 12,908 people, ended up in a hospital or have died from a breakthrough infection, according to CDC numbers. Of those who were hospitalized, 70 percent were age 65 or older and 87 percent of deaths were in that age group. The agency’s data isn’t a complete picture but is based on reports it’s received from 49 US states and territories. Nebraska stopped publicly reporting state numbers in July.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) MISSOURI SCHOOL BOARD MEETING ON MASKS ENDS WITH PARKING LOT BRAWL It is difficult to ascertain how many new cases reported in the US are breakthrough infections because the CDC only tracks such cases that lead to hospitalization and deaths, but the agency said the data it has draws a clear conclusion: The risks of infection, death and hospitalization ""are all much lower in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated people."" At least 35 states do track breakthrough cases at the local level, but only a portion of them report the data in ""a useful format,"" making it hard to track, according to a Johns Hopkins blog post published Tuesday. ""When discussing breakthrough cases it is essential to remember that breakthrough cases are expected and normal, but it is still important to record and share data on them,"" the blog post states. ""The CDC only reports breakthrough cases that rise to the level of hospitalization, putting the burden of complete data reporting on state health departments,"" the posting said. ""This creates a gap in knowledge regarding infection and transmission patterns in communities with mixed vaccination status."" While New York is one of the states that does not track breakthrough infections, newly minted Gov. Kathy Hochul provided a glimpse during a press briefing on Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Between January and Sept. 5, the state health department has recorded 58,030 breakthrough infections, representing just 0.5 percent of fully vaccinated New Yorkers age 12 and older. Of those cases, 4,585, or 0.04 percent, have led to a hospital stay. Considering that many breakthrough infections are believed to be asymptomatic, the number is likely an undercount, but Hochul noted, ""It is still a rarity."" ""We need everyone to get vaccinated. Our vaccination rates are better than they are in most states, but if you are unvaccinated, you are still vulnerable,"" Hochul said. In New York state, 61 percent of people 12 and older are fully vaccinated. ""The vaccine works and it’s essential that you complete the vaccine series, and get the booster shot when the time comes.""

Media allies and fellow Democrats who haddefended his mental acuityand fitness for office changed their tune and called for him to exit the race, and despite his initial claims only God could get him out, he finally succumbed to pressure and stepped aside.

The Guardian,Fani Willis subpoenaed in divorce case involving Trump prosecutor,"Fani Willis, Georgia’s Fulton county district attorney who brought election interference charges against Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants, has been subpoenaed in a divorce case involving a special prosecutor she hired in the Trump case.Related:‘Totally baseless’: Trump denounced for Nikki Haley ‘birther’ lieA process server delivered the subpoena to Willis’s office on Monday,according toa court filing reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the subpoena. The subpoena requests Willis to testify in the divorce case involving her top prosecutor Nathan Wade and his wife Joycelyn Wade.The Wades filed for divorce in Cobb county, just outside Atlanta, in November 2021, according to a county court docket. The filings in the case have been sealed since February 2022.Earlier this week, Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official and co-defendant in the election interference case who is facing seven criminal charges,filed a motionaccusing Willis and Nathan Wade of an “improper, clandestine personal relationship during the pendency of this case”. The filing offered no proof of the relationship or of any wrongdoing.The motionclaimedthat the alleged relationship between Willis and Nathan Wade resulted in “the special prosecutor, and, in turn, the district attorney, profiting significantly from this prosecution at the expense of the taxpayers”.“Willis has benefited substantially and directly, and continues to benefit, from this litigation because Wade is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to prosecute this case on her behalf,” the motionstates.“He will continue to be incentivized to prosecute this case based on his personal and financial motives, so he has acquired a unique and personal interest or stake in Mr Roman’s continued prosecution. That is, he is motivated to prosecute Mr Roman for as long as possible because he will continue to make exorbitant sums of money,” the motionadded.According tocounty records reviewed by the Hill, Nathan Wade was paid nearly $654,000 in legal fees in 2022 and 2023 as he worked on the election interference case.The motion furtherclaimed– without evidence – that Willis and Nathan Wade traveled together to vacation destinations including Florida, Napa Valley and the Caribbean.The Guardian has contacted Willis and Nathan Wade for comment. Neither have yet spoken publicly on the subpoena.",1,
Fox News,Israel-Hamas war: 8 more Israeli hostages released ahead of cease-fire expiration,"Mia Schem, 21, was one of hostages that the Israel Defense Forces says was released by Hamas on Thursday from the Gaza Strip. Hamas militants released eight moreIsraeli hostagesand three bodies Thursday as a cease-fire with Israel was expected to expire. The Israeli military said six Israeli hostages had been released from captivity in the Gaza Strip and transferred to Egypt by the Red Cross late Thursday. They arrived hours after two additional hostages were turned over to Israel separately. From Egypt, the newly freed hostages were to be transferred to Israel to be reunited with their families after nearly eight weeks in captivity.

Fox News,"UN revises Gaza death toll, almost 50% less women and children killed than previously reported","The UN revised its death count for women and children in Gaza, cutting it by almost 50% in its latest calculation. (Credit: UNTV) JERUSALEM – In a dramatic shift, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has revised its data pertaining to the number of Palestinian casualties in the seven-month-old Gaza war, reducing almost by half the number of women and children it previously said were killed in the hostilities between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group Hamas. According to an infographic published inOCHA’s daily report on May 6, the number of women killed in the fighting was said to be 9,500, while the organization, which admits to relying on figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, claimed that 14,500 children had been killed since the war began on Oct. 7. Two days later, in its May 8 report,the U.N. agency appeared to have cut the number nearly in half, showing instead that some 4,959 women and 7,797 children had been killed so far in the war, which began after thousands of Hamas-led terrorists infiltrated southern Israel from Gaza, slaughtering more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 people hostage. BIDEN ADMIN SHOULD CHECK HAMAS' MINISTRY OF HEALTH DEATH STATS, EXPERT WARNS Smoke billows after the Israeli army launched an airstrike on Al Mughraqa area in the Gaza Strip on April 14, 2024.(Photo by Ashraf Amra/Anadolu via Getty Images) While the numbers on both sides remain high – the overall death count in Gaza is said by the Hamas-controlled ministry of health to have almost reached 35,000, with more believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings – the sudden and unexplained change in numbers is alarming. Hamas’ death toll figures have been disputed by Israel, which claims more than a third of those killed are combatants, yet they have been widely and unquestioningly quoted by the international media, humanitarian organizations and world leaders, including President Biden. ""U.N. agencies have consistently shown they prefer to trust the numbers coming out of Hamas-controlled sources rather than doing basic due diligence"" They have also been used as the basis to question whether the Israeli army may have violated international humanitarian law and to accuse the Israeli government of committing genocide, or, at the very least, of deliberately targeting civilians. The Israelis estimate that around 14,000 terrorists have been killed since the fighting in Gaza began. President Biden, in his State of the Union address in March, quoted Hamas’s numbers, which at the time stood at 30,000. He also used the unverified data to commission a State Department inquiry into Israel’s conduct, resulting in a report that was published on Friday.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News Digital that the breakdowns were based on data from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, and that those figures ""can vary based on their own verification process that they undertake."" ""The United Nations teams on the ground in Gaza are unable to independently verify those figures given the prevailing situation on the ground and the sheer volume of fatalities,"" the spokesman said. ""It is for this reason that all figures used by the U.N. clearly cite the Health Ministry in Gaza as the source.""

""Israel has repeatedly said the numbers coming out of Gaza and which are being echoed by U.N. agencies are being manipulated by Hamas, are not accurate, and do not reflect the reality on the ground,"" an Israeli official told Fox News Digital.The official said Israel was still waiting for OCHA to acknowledge that an incident at a hospital early on in the war that killed nearly 100 civilians was actually caused by an errant rocket fired by one of the Gaza terror groups and to recognize that Hamas uses U.N. infrastructure for its terror activities. ""All of these are consistently ignored in OCHA’s reports,"" the official said. ""Parroting Hamas propaganda messages without any verification process has proven time and again as methodologically flawed and unprofessional,"" the official added. ""We urge the international community to use more than a grain of salt when evaluating OCHA reports.""

""U.N. agencies have consistently shown they prefer to trust the numbers coming out of Hamas-controlled sources rather than doing basic due diligence,"" he said, adding that the U.N.’s sudden revision last week of the death toll most likely indicated that ""even Hamas-controlled sources have begun admitting that their numbers are based on incomplete data."" ""They [Hamas] don't even have the names of more than 10,000 of the individuals they count as dead,"" Adesnik said. The change by the U.N., he said, was ""a step forward for the U.N., even though it still has a long way to go, as do Western journalists, who are often the most vocal defenders of the numbers from Hamas-controlled sources.""

""Despite the numbers, Israel is setting the bar very high on civilian harm mitigation steps,"" Spencer, who is also host of the Urban Warfare Project podcast and serves as the chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the New York-based Madison Policy Forum, told Fox News Digital in February. He outlined how the Israeli military took measures that no other military, including the U.S., had previously taken during war such as calling and texting individuals to warn them of a forthcoming air strike and sharing maps with plans for military maneuvers in certain areas. Biden, last week, threatened to halt some armaments deliveries to Israel if it decides to launch a full scale military offensive in the Strip’s southernmost city of Rafah, a maneuver Israel says is essential in order to wipe out the remainingHamas battalionsand end the war.

Israel also believes that many of the remaining 132 hostages are being held there. Over the weekend, the Israel Defense Forces said it had begun precise military operations in the area of eastern Rafah, after urging more than 300,000 Gazans to move into humanitarian safe zones away from the fighting. On Sunday, the army said in a statement that its troops operating in Rafah had located and dismantled a number of tunnel shafts and rocket launchers, which were used to fire towards Israel, including the crossing used to transport humanitarian aid into the Strip.

Breitbart,Fact Check: Andrew Cuomo Falsely Labels Coronavirus ‘European Virus’,"CLAIM: At the Democrat National Convention (DNC), New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) suggested the Chinese coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, “infected the northeast” from Europe. VERDICT: False. Federal officials with the State Department and the intelligence community have said evidence is clear that the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading around the world and eventually to the United States. On Monday evening, during his speech at the DNC, Cuomo labeled the coronavirus “the European virus,” suggesting it arrived from Europe, not China. “In fact, [the White House] didn’t even see it coming. The European virus infected the northeast while the White House still fixated on China,” Cuomo said. “The virus had been attacking us for months before they even knew it was here.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, since May,has saidthere is “enormous evidence” that the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan lab. A month prior, federal intelligence officialsconfirmedthat the coronavirus did originate in China. “There’s enormous evidence that that’s where this began,” Pompeo said in reference to a Wuhan lab. “We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outset. But I think the whole world can see now.” Cuomo’s assertion that the coronavirus “had been attacking us for months before they even knew it was here” does not acknowledge that the presidentbanned travelfrom China as early as January. Later, in February and March, Trump went on toban travelfrom Iran and Europe — both hotspots of the coronavirus at the time. Most recently, Trump banned travel from Brazil due to its high caseload.

AP News,"No pain, no gain? Hardly. This year’s fitness buzzword is ‘recovery’","If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X. The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining. “I didn’t know then what I know now,” said Horton, who had spent the ’90s training celebrities. “Back then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.” His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a“no pain, no gain”mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is “recovery.” Horton — who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance — noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled withplenty of good sleep,plunges in frigid waterbaths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery. “If you don’t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you’re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,” Horton said.  Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to “feel the burn,” while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods. NASM’s “Fitness and Wellness” certification includes training in “holistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.” The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured. But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they’re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice. “It’s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,” he said. “Are you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it’s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.” The “no pain, no gain” motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal. Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights “until failure” may build bigger muscles, but isn’t needed to increase strength. “There is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,” he said. To realize the health benefits of a workout, it’s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: “In the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there’s gotta be a certain amount of strain.” There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement. People’s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines: For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it’s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles. In between workouts, it’s not necessary to stay still. “You’re welcome to do walking, jogging, verylight yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,” Kravchencko said. “That’s all fine, because it’s not specifically targeting the areas you’ve targeted before.” Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting —meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said. Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent. “What is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?” he said. “A lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.” AP reporter Maria Cheng in London contributed to this story.

Jacobin,Jacobin,"In the past two decades, a succession of crises has led to the rise of authoritarian states, acutely showing how capitalism and democracy were never compatible to begin with. A squad of police stand on guard during a demonstration against the new pension reform law in Paris, France, June 6, 2023. (Telmo Pinto / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images) Our new issue, “Bye Bye Bidenism,” is out now.Subscribeto our print edition at a discounted rate today. It’s increasingly hard to ignore the fact that democracy around the world is in retreat. On the one hand, many of the world’s most powerful states — from China to Saudi Arabia — are governed by authoritarian administrations that seem only to be growing in strength. On the other hand, the respect for liberal democratic norms — like the right to protest and the independence of the judiciary — is on the decline in established governments. And many states that seemed to be on the road to democracy — like Hungary and Turkey — are stuck in a kind of “illiberal democratic” purgatory. In total, around 72 percent of the world’s population lives under some form of authoritarian rule, according to some experts. Researchers at Freedom House claim that around 38 percent of the world’s population live in countries that can be characterized as “not free.” Liberal academic Larry Diamond has termed the retreat of democracy around the world a “democratic recession.” The erosion of democracy has been particularly hard for liberals to conceptualize. After all, things were not supposed to be this way. The fall of the Berlin Wall was meant to finally put an end to any outstanding questions about the compatibility of democracy and capitalism. The latter was inevitably going to expand, bringing with it the rights and freedoms that many in the rich world had come to take for granted. The rest of the world was destined to converge on the model pioneered by the West. Liberal theorists and policymakers have come up with a number of arguments to explain the apparent contradiction between the spread of capitalism and the retreat of democracy. Those on the right of the political spectrum locate the problem with foreign “enemies of democracy.” For these pioneers of the new Cold War, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin — though curiously not Mohammed bin Salman or Viktor Orbán — are to blame for brainwashing the democracy-loving peoples of the West with authoritarian propaganda. Centrists tend to claim the real issue is “extremists on both sides,” arguing that democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, who have never even come close to achieving state power, share just as much of the blame for the democratic retreat as former world leaders on the populist right likeBoris JohnsonandDonald Trump. Every evaluation of the problem is, of course, entirely individualistic. Many liberals genuinely believe that the greatest challenge to democracy today is a few “bad guys” corrupting an otherwise well-functioning system. These arguments are, of course, utterly absurd. Support for democracy is not in decline because voters are being brainwashed by enemy propaganda on TikTok. Support for democracy is declining because democracy is simply not working the way we were told it would. Firstly, the combination of capitalism and democracy was supposed to bring prosperity and progress to all nations that adopted them. For a brief time after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when globalization went into overdrive, this seemed a believable story. The financial crisis brought this collective delusion to an end in the Global North. Members of the generation that came of age during the crisis of 2008 have had to adjust to the reality that they are unlikely to be better off than their parents. But even before the financial crisis, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s showed many in the developing world that opening up one’s markets to international capital could be a recipe for disaster. Some combination of authoritarianism and market controls seemed like the natural response. Secondly, the progress brought by democracy and capitalism was supposed to give rise to yet more democracy. Checks and balances would put an end to corruption. An educated population would choose the “right” leaders. And rather than campaigning based on outdated ideologies, those leaders would compete for votes by appealing to the “median voter,” bringing moderation to previously divided societies. Instead, corruption is on the rise, ideology is back, and people keep picking the “wrong” leaders. Perhaps the creation of societies so stratified that the ruling class can barely comprehend the concerns of ordinary voters was not such a foolproof recipe for democracy after all. Some slightly more thoughtful commentators accept that this astonishingly simplistic reading might not capture the whole story. In a new podcast series for theFinancial Times,Martin Wolfseems genuinely concerned about the future of democracy — and accepts a small part of the blame for himself and his colleagues. The problem, Wolf seems to believe, is that neoliberals, in all their zeal for the end of history, spread free markets too far and too fast. The shock therapy of the 1990s was not coupled with measures to alleviate the social and economic tensions that came with it. The argument is reminiscent of that put forward by progressive political theoristKarl Polanyi, who believed that capitalist free markets spread too quickly for societies to adapt. Those whose lives and ideals were threatened by the emergence of this brave new world would push back against the encroachment of the “market society” — often supporting authoritarian strongmen to do so. Progressive liberals like Wolf tend to believe that the solution to the problem will come in some form of regulated capitalism. Often, these commentators are Keynesians who advocate a return to the social democratic consensus of the postwar period. But this kind of nostalgia is no healthier than that evinced by Trump fans longing for a return to a world before the spread of “gender ideology.” There is, after all, a reason why the Keynesian consensus broke down. As soon as economic growth slowed, the latent battle between workers and bosses that had been bubbling away below the surface suddenly exploded into the political mainstream. Without excess profits extracted from the rest of the world to keep this conflict under wraps, there was only one choice for the ruling class: all-out war on workers. For this reason, despite the fact that it is blindingly obvious that capitalist democracies require some measures to reduce inequality while tackling climate breakdown, the progressive capitalist vision for the future stands no chance of being implemented. There’s only one conclusion left to draw — that capitalism and democracy were never really all that compatible to begin with.

With no fewer than 127 bullet points, it’s the most comprehensive criminal justice plan released by any Democratic presidential candidate. As a random example, Sanders’s plan doesn’t just affirm the right to counsel for people without the means to pay — it proposes seven reforms to guarantee that right in practice. That granularity is characteristic of the whole document. The plan’s heft and substance should put to rest the rumor that Sanders talks pretty but is thin on details. Moreover, the plan has implications that extend far beyond his own campaign. For years, civil rights and criminal justice reform activists and organizations have been looking beyond procedural reforms. Increasingly, they’ve been training their sights on substantive change outside the criminal justice sphere itself, seeking community investment solutions that can improve living standards, improve safety, and over time displace police and prisons. Meanwhile, Sanders has been searching for a way to apply his democratic socialist ideas to criminal justice issues. The Justice and Safety for All plan represents the confluence of these currents: a democratic socialist looking to apply his political vision to criminal justice meets a criminal justice reform movement hungry for radical social interventions. “My feeling had always been that the idea of producing public safety through community investment instead of policing was completely compatible with a democratic socialist agenda,” says Alex Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the author ofThe End of Policing. Vitale, who is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), was tapped to assist the Sanders campaign in drafting its criminal justice plan. “I said to the Sanders folks, look, this is happening.” The core civil rights and criminal justice organizations with a national reach “are all moving in a direction that’s consistent with your political vision. There’s been a massive shift within the civil rights community and among activists away from procedural reforms and toward community reinvestment.” At the time of the early Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, the most popular demands emanating from the movement were still procedural reforms to policing. We heard a lot about body cameras, a database of police shootings, and prosecution of police officers who kill unarmed civilians. But a few years into Black Lives Matter, many activists and organizations started to feel that these measures alone were insufficient. Reforming the police was crucial, but it wouldn’t be enough. And while there were necessary changes to make to prisons and the legal system, reforms there would not suffice either. Thus we saw a new political orientation take shape, with activists shifting their focus from reforming police and prisons to reformingsociety, so that the role of police and prisons could be minimized. Groups like the Movement for Black Lives and the Black Youth Project 100 “have been the cutting edge” of this transformation, says Vitale. In 2014, 150 groups came together in the Movement for Black Lives coalition. When itreleased a platformin 2016, the evolution was apparent. The coalition’s demands went far beyond the call for body cameras and databases. Demandsincludeduniversal health care, quality tuition-free public education and childcare, full employment, and housing for all. In many ways, the demands of the movement started to resemble those of Bernie Sanders. That evolution made Sanders’s overall political approach a natural fit, but it took a while for the pieces to come together. One reason for the delay was that Sanders himself was struggling to articulate what his political vision had to offer in the way of criminal justice solutions. For example, Sanders began to talk more aboutprivate prisons. It seemed obvious: Sanders is the nation’s leading critic of the distortions of the profit motive within the public sector. The problem is that private prisons are just the tip of the iceberg. The same went for cash bail, an issue Sanders himself helpedelevate to prominence. It’s true that cash bail in effect criminalizes poverty and must end, but it’s just one aspect of a deeply broken system. Thus, for a few years, Sanders tried in earnest but struggled to connect the dots between his democratic socialist political vision and the juggernaut of mass incarceration and overpolicing. That started to change this year, when his second presidential campaign sought to make connections (though still nascent) with criminal justice and civil rights activists and organizations in the post–Black Lives Matter landscape. Through that effort, it appears that the Sanders campaign has finally found the sweet spot. These groups and individuals are bringing to the table an analysis of policing and prisons as an unsuitable substitute for public investment in dispossessed communities, particularly communities of color. To scale down the role of police and prisons in society, we must build up social programs and improve living standards for the poor and marginalized. And when it comes to building up an alternative to the carceral apparatus, that’s Bernie’s strong suit. The new synthesis can be found throughout the Justice and Safety for All plan. The plan includes plenty of concrete reforms to the legal system, prisons, and policing. But it also repeatedly emphasizes the need to divert funds and resources into building healthier communities, consistent with the Movement for Black Lives’invest-diveststrategy. “We need to shift our emphasis toward solving problems in ways that don’t rely on policing and incarceration as a first option by supporting alternative strategies to make individuals and communities safer and healthier,” says the plan. “When Bernie is president, we will finally make the deep and structural investments to rebuild the communities that mass incarceration continues to decimate,” it reads. “We must move away from an overly-punitive approach to public safety and start focusing on how to safeguard our communities, prevent the conditions that lead to arrests, and rehabilitate people who have made mistakes.” In practice, what that means is that a Sanders administration won’t just ban the prosecution of youth in adult courts and end solitary confinement for juveniles, though these are necessary reforms in their own right. It will also “invest in school nurses, counselors, teachers, teaching assistants, and small class sizes to address disciplinary issues” — provisions that are already laid out in Sanders’sThurgood Marshall Plan for Education.Similarly, a Sanders administration will not only end the war on drugs, it will also legalize safe injection sites and invest public money in addiction treatment and overdose prevention services. There is already a role for substance abuse treatment carved out in Sanders’sMedicare for Allplan. And a Sanders administration will not only reduce the number of inmates by arresting fewer people and releasing more from jail; it will also guarantee safe and affordable housing and job training on the outside, before and after incarceration. These demands are already present in Sanders’s21st Century Bill of Economic Rights. None of this is a stretch for Sanders. His presidential campaign has always been predicated on the idea that we must tax the rich and corporations, and redistribute society’s wealth to the working class and the poor in the form of robust universal social programs, which enshrine as rights things like health care, education, housing, a good job, a secure retirement, and a clean environment. What was missing was a bridge connecting the rest of his platform to criminal justice reform. With the release of the Justice for All plan, it appears the connection has been made. The plan simultaneously reflects Sanders’s evolution on criminal justice specifics and the contemporary criminal justice reform movement’s evolution on systemic social issues. The result, says Vitale, is a statement unlike any other circulating in the electoral sphere. “The Sanders document says we need to quit using the police and prisons to solve problems” like poverty, mental illness, substance abuse, and even crime itself, and instead “actually fix the communities.” Let’s hope this idea goes mainstream.

BBC News,FMQs: Tories say size of SNP state is 'out of control' as Labour highlight education 'failures',"John Swinney faces questions from opposition party leaders and backbench MSPs at FMQS This week Scottish Lib Dems leader Alex Cole-Hamilton joins the Conservatives' Russell Findlay and Labour's Anas Sarwar in posing the questions The leaders all begin by saying they stand with Ukraine on the third anniversary of the Russian invasion Findlay challenges Swinney on the number of public bodies in Scotland and says the size of the SNP state is ""out of control"" The FM says the number of public bodies has fallen since the SNP came to power Sarwar points to the attainment gap and says generations of young Scots are being let down by education standards Cole-Hamilton raises the number of people over the age of 85 waiting 12 hours in A&E - while Swinney says overall numbers are dropping Swinney insists the government is creating better outcomes for young people That brings this week's coverage of FMQs to a close. Here are the key lines that emerged this lunchtime: Today's editor was Paul McLaren. The writers were Ashleigh Keenan-Bryce and Craig Hutchison. Thank you for joining us. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent If weâre honest about it, there
werenât really any spectacular fireworks at FMQs today. The key thing in
building an electoral platform is repetition; the idea is to craft a
distinctive message which voters readily associate with you, but you might have
to repeat it a hundred times in order to get it to stick. Thatâs why every week
now Russell Findlay finds a way to talk about âcommon senseâ and the cosy
left-wing consensus at Holyrood. Anas Sarwar talks about
a ânew directionâ away from the SNPâs lengthy period in charge, and indeed has
started to cast himself as a first ministerial figure. And John Swiney has
familiar rebuttals - about Labourâs record of delivery at Westminster, and
Russell Findlayâs courting of potential Reform voters. If you watch every week,
it can start to look like theyâre going through familiar motions; thereâs a
danger it might even get boring. But there is a political
strategy at play. At this point itâs still a long game, with the election a
year away, but things will only get more pointed as time goes on. Another FMQs and another question about CalMac ferries, this week from SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson. He highlights CalMac's reshuffle of timetables due to ""exceptional issues"" which caused a third of its large vessels fleet to be out of action and which could lead to a ""summer of chaos"". ""CalMac faces an incredibly congested set of circumstances as a consequence of issues in the ferry fleet,"" replies Swinney. The FM says CalMac has undertaken planning work to ensure routes can be serviced - work which will be kept under constant review. He points out the Glen Sannox is operational now between Troon and Arran and there are four other vessels due to join the fleet, along with the Glen Sannox's sister ship the Glen Rosa. Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland environment correspondent Michael Goldie lost more than half his lambs in January through the Schmallenberg virus A livestock farmer has lost more than half his newborn lambs in one of the first Scottish cases of a deadly virus - and fears he could be wiped out if his farm is struck by any more diseases. The Schmallenberg virus killed up to 92 of the 152 lambs that Michael Goldie was expecting to deliver last month at his farm in Dundonald near Troon in Ayrshire. Scotland had remained largely free of the Schmallenberg virus until January but concern is growing after a spike in cases. The country's chief vet, Sheila Voas, says the disease is just one of an unusually high number of threats being faced by farmers. She believes it is inevitable that other diseases will spread to Scotland and is urging farmers to be extra vigilant for warning signs. Tory MSP Brian Whittle asks what action the Scottish government is taking to support farmers responding to threats to livestock from disease. The first minister replies: ""There are an unusually high number of threats faced by farmers at the moment, including avian influenza, blue tongue, foot and mouth disease and Schmallenberg."" Swinney goes on to explain his government is working with the farming industry to address these threats. He says he shares Whittle's concern about the sustainability of farming and the impact of the UK Labour government's changes to inheritance tax. The FM says the government has put in place a financial settlement of over Â£600m for the farming sector which the Tory MSP did not back in Tuesday's budget vote. To the backbenches, and SNP MSP Michael Matheson highlights the recent study by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit regarding the contribution of the net zero sector to the Scottish and UK economy. Swinney says he welcomes the report which sets out the importance of the net zero sector to the country's economy. He says the green economy is thriving, growing 20% in the last two years, generating over Â£9bn and supporting over 100,000 full time equivalent jobs. The first minister says it is ""absolutely imperative"" to take climate action urgently and this report helps illustrate there is also economic opportunity in the transition to net zero. The first minister replies: ""I'm sorry to Winifred and to her family for the experience that they have had."" He goes on to highlight the ""extraordinary pressures"" the health service faces as a consequence of flu. Swinney says 12-hour waits in A&E are completely unacceptable but are falling. It's now the turn of the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader to ask his questions - and he focuses on NHS waiting times. Alex Cole-Hamilton asks about 87-year-old Winifred who broke her hip and whose treatment left her family ""aghast"". It included a 12-hour wait in A&E, an unsafe discharge, a nine-hour wait for an ambulance and yet another 12-hour wait in A&E, he says. Cole-Hamilton tells the chamber more than 12,000 people aged over 85 waited longer than 12 hours in Scotland's A&E departments and he argues the SNP has failed Winifred and others like her. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Most
weeks, Anas Sarwar uses health to illustrate his argument that the SNP has been
in charge for too long and is letting services down. But
today he alighted on another key devolved portfolio - education. The
fact this was based on some statistics published this week meant the exchanges
quickly turned into a blizzard of figures flying back and forth. There are, as
ever, enough for both sides to pick some out which suit their own arguments. John
Swinney is a former education secretary, so it serves Mr Sarwarâs purpose to
say heâs to blame for any issues â but it also means he knows them inside out,
and has rebuttals to hand. It
was once again a case of Labour and the SNP seeking to compete on similar
political territory. And
if Mr Sarwar closed with a familiar flourish about the SNP having ânobody else
to blameâ, Mr Swinney did too with his weekly refrain on âbroken promisesâ from
Labour at Westminster. Sarwar says Swinney's record is ""woeful"" and says he, as first minister, would make sure every young Scot can reach their potential by introducing new education standards. Sarwar asks the first minister whether their defining mission, of improving Scottish education, is now their defining failure. says Scotland is the only part of the UK where child poverty is expected to fall where it is expected to rise in the rest of the UK. The first minister says he would encourage the people of Scotland to look at what the SNP government have done to support children in Scotland, compared to the Labour governments in England and Wales. The first minister says  says the percentage of young people in a ""positive destination"" three months after leaving school is 95.7% - the second highest since records began. Swinney says he accepts work has to be done, but Sarwar must accept the improvements put on record as a result of investment by the SNP government. Sarwar says Swinney was the person charged with improving Scottish education and he has ""failed"". He says, last year, 42.6% of pupils left school without a single Higher or equivalent and 1,300 students left school without ""the most basic of qualifications"". The Scottish Labour says ""every one of these children should matter"" and asks the first minister why the SNP government are ""letting down"" a generation of young people. The first minister says the overall poverty-related attainment gap has reduced by 60% since 2009-10. Swinney says the gap in young people in the most deprived areas is at a record low in primary schools. Turning to pupils with additional support learning needs, the attainment gap between those with additional support needs and those without has reduced by almost half since 2009-10, he says. The FM adds: ""I accept there is more that needs to be done but important and substantial progress has been made in closing the attainment gap and that is good for children and young people in our country."" Before FMQs began, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also
paid tribute to the people of Ukraine. He said for 1,999 days, they have felt the fear and
heartbreak at the brunt of Russian aggression but still stand stronge. Beginning his questions to the first minister, Sarwar turns
to education. He cites the latest figures indicating theattainment gapbetween
Scotland's richest and poorest school pupils increased last year. He asks the first minister if Scottish education is going
the wrong direction under the SNP. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent Russell
Findlay has a real bee in his bonnet about the size of the public sector. He
actually delved back to a committee meeting from last week to make a point
about the number of public bodies. If
imitation is the greatest form of flattery, he will feel vindicated that Anas
Sarwar has just pinched his idea for a Scottish version of Elon Muskâs
Department for Government Efficiency. But
his problem today was that John Swinney had apparently seen his attack coming,
and had a statistic ready to bat it away. Ultimately
these were fairly muted exchanges, but both leaders got their favourite lines
in. Russell
Findlay got to badge his position as âbasic common senseâ, while John Swinney
got to celebrate his budget passing earlier in the week â channelling funding
towards frontline services. There
were few fireworks, but both of them will no doubt find a way of cutting a clip
for their social media feeds. The Scottish Tory leader points to a ""bloated SNP state"" which he says is out of control. Findlay asks if Swinney will bring in a credible business leader to sort this out. The first minister insists he takes this issue very seriously. He argues the Tories opposed the creation of Police Scotland which delivered Â£200m in savings and he accuses Findlay of hypocrisy. On 1 December 2024 there were 131 public bodies in the country, replies Swinney. Back to Findlay, who says the information commissioner and the auditor general play a game called ""public authority bingo"" - hinting that they can only guess at figures. The Scottish Tory leader calls on the FM to spell out the exact number of public bodies there are in Scotland. The first minister argues that his government has reduced the number of public bodies in Scotland and maintains a stringent approach to public expenditure. John Swinney says it constantly strives to maximise value and those considerations underpinned the budget passed on Tuesday. The Scottish Tory leader says there are hundreds or even thousands of public bodies in Scotland. Findlay says the information commissioner describes a ""hidden and complicated landscape across the public sector"". He says if the commissioner can't tell the size of the SNP state, what chance will the public have.",2,

BBC News,Starmer and Badenoch clash over economy at PMQs,"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has challenged Sir Keir Starmer over the government's handling of the economy, saying the UK was now ""spending more on debt than on schools and hospitals"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch told MPs: ""His budget means fewer jobs, lower growth and higher borrowing costs"", and she asked whether Chancellor Rachel Reeves was planning to raise taxes in a March mini-budget. Defending his chancellor, the prime minister said the government's fiscal rules were ""iron clad"", and the government ""can't just tax and spend our way out of [the] problems"". And he said Reeves would be chancellor for ""many, many years to come"". Recent market turbulence has meant the cost of servicing UK debt has risen, and the last few days have seen pressures on the public finances increase, after government borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years. Attacking the Conservatives as ""economic vandals and fantasists"", Sir Keir said his focus was on growth. ""They flatlined the economy and left us with the worst cost of living crisis in living history and a Â£22bn black hole, so I won't be taking lesson on the economy from them,"" he said. Badenoch said the Office for Budget Responsibility ""found no such black hole"" and said two-thirds of businesses have complained they will need to raise prices as a result of Labour's first budget, which raised national insurance costs for employers. ""The prime minister claims he has full confidence in [Rachel Reeves] but the markets clearly do not,"" she said, adding: ""Labour congratulated themselves in having the first female chancellor, instead of ensuring they had somebody who was qualified for the job."" The Conservative leader also highlighted that the PM has lost two ministers in as many months, with theresignation of city minister Tulip Siddiq, and theresignation of transport minister Louise Haighat the end of November due to an historic fraud conviction. Sir Keir dismissed Badenoch's insults as ""cheap political points"" and compared the resignations to the actions of the current Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, whoremained in post as home secretarydespite being found to have breached the ministerial code. And he delivered his own barb at the Tories' former leader Liz Truss, whosent the PM a letterdemanding Labour stop claiming she ""crashed the economy"" as it was damaging her reputation. Sir Keir said: ""It wasn't written in green ink but it might as well have been. ""It was actually crashing the economy that damaged her reputation.""",2,
BBC News,Work completed on new Â£45m entertainment complex,"Construction work on Prestonâs new Â£45m cinema and leisure complex has been completed.

The Guardian,Black-owned bookshops call for more diversity in UK publishing,"Black-owned bookshops in the UK are calling for better representation of black authors in the long-term after reporting a surge in interest following the protests over the summer sparked by the killing of George Floyd and byBlack History Month.“We want people to see reading books by black authors as a habit, as opposed to something you pick up in October”, said Carolynn Bain, who set up an online shop stocking books of black origin in July after she became frustrated by the lack of black literature available in the UK.She expected her venture, Afrori Books, to be a side-hustle at most but interest in black writers skyrocketed as a result of the Black Lives Matter protests, and business is booming.“We’ve grown massively,” she said. “We have quite a lot of returning customers, so we’re getting something right. My little side-hustle is actually now about 10 hours a day.”Jacaranda, a publisher and bookseller thatspecialises in promoting diverse writers, also saw an increase in sales after the BLM protests. “It’s so bittersweet; on the one hand it’s good that people are paying attention and are learning and they want to educate themselves,” said sales manager Jazzmine Breary. “Our only hope is that it continues, it should not take the death and suffering of black people for it to happen. Let it continue. Let it not be the only moment.”Bernardine EvaristoandReni Eddo-Lodgebecame the first black British women to top the UK’s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts in June on the back of soaring book sales, with Eddo-Lodge describing it “a horrible indictment of the publishing industry” that it had taken so long.The veteran bookseller New Beacon Books in north London, the UK’s first black publisher and specialist bookshop, has also benefited from the surging demand for black literature. It has lived through dozens of mass movements, but the events of this year have sparked something different, according to its director, Michael La Rose.“The consciousness-raising of the global BLM movement has made every country question what is going on in their societies – people want to know what has happened in the past, to get books, to get information, to get facts,” said La Rose, the son of John La Rose, who founded the business with his partner, Sarah White, in 1966. “That led to more business on our website and people walking into the bookshop.”Like most retailers, the bookshop has taken a hit this year because of lockdown, and La Rose said a “sustained movement” was needed to ensure the longevity of specialist black bookshops in the future.Initiatives such asblack pound day, in which consumers are encouraged to shop at black-owned businesses once a month, have helped the retailer in the face of online competition from Amazon, he said, but momentum needs to be maintained.Renewed focus on the lack of diversity in publishing and literature has prompted new initiatives, such as Penguin’s recently announced projectto boost diversity in GCSE reading lists, and the newly formed Black Writers’ Guild has been pushing for action from the big publishing houses.But bookshop owners say there’s a long way to go before the publishing industry and mainstream bookshops fully reflect the diversity of black talent in the UK.“In the long term, my aim and my hope is that we will stop being a bookshop that stocks black authors and just be a bookshop, because we won’t need to be highlighting this stuff, but we’re a long, long way from that,” said Bain.“But what we’re doing is actually changing the world, because if you read a book by a black author, it changes the way you see things, it changes the way you see black people. And that can only be positive.”",1,

BBC News,"Trump 'resorted to crimes' to overturn 2020 election, prosecutors say","Donald Trump ""resorted to crimes"" while trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and should not escape charges, prosecutors say. A new court filing challenges Trump's claim that he should avoid a trial thanks to a recent landmark US Supreme Court ruling. This said American presidents should be immune from prosecution when acting in an ""official"" capacity. Trump was president when the alleged offences were committed - but prosecutors say he was acting in a ""private"" capacity, not an official one. In response, Trump has repeated false claims that the 2020 vote was ""rigged"" and suggested the timing of the filing's release was designed to hurt his 2024 campaign. In an interview with NewsNation, he also criticised Special Counsel Jack Smith, the lead prosecutor in the election interference probe who submitted the filing. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan released the document - filed by Mr Smith last week - with redactions on Wednesday. This is one of four criminal cases Trump has faced since being voted out in 2020 - another of which led to a historic conviction in New York. He is accused of seeking to illegally block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, but denies wrongdoing. The new 165-page document presents the clearest view yet of how Mr Smith's team would pursue their case, having tweaked the wording of their charges after the Supreme Court's intervention. It gives details of Trump's alleged scheme, including his actions when his supporters rioted at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021. It also outlines the efforts of Mike Pence, the vice-president at the time, to talk him down. The issue remains prominent in US politics almost four years later, ahead of the 2024 election in November, which will be contested by Trump and Kamala Harris. It came up in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate, during which JD Vance refused to answer whether Trump, his running mate for 2024, lost in 2020. Trump has some immunity from prosecution, Supreme Court rules Trump faces revised 2020 charges after Supreme Court ruling A guide to Trump's criminal cases Donald Trump: A quick guide to the Republican presidential nominee The court filing may represent Mr Smith's last chance to set out his case against Trump. The case has been frequently delayed since charges were filed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) more than a year ago. Chutkan has given Trump's team until 7 November - two days after the presidential election - to respond to the latest filing. The filing means he will not face trial before November's election - and he could seek to have the case dropped if he wins. Trump's lawyers fought to keep the latest filing sealed. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung has called it ""falsehood-ridden"" and ""unconstitutional"". In the newly released document, Mr Smith and his team try to navigate the summer Supreme Court ruling - which dented their case - by narrowing their scope. The Supreme Court ruling did not apply immunity to unofficial acts. The prosecutors argue that although Trump was still in office when attempting to overturn the 2020 vote, his attempts related to his campaign and his life as a private citizen. They call it a ""private criminal effort"". The court should therefore ""determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as he would any other citizen,"" the filing says. The filing lays out several instances in which Pence expressed doubt about his boss's voter fraud claims and tried to persuade him to accept he lost the election. In the court document, prosecutors say Trump was not upset when he learned his vice-president had been rushed to a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021. ""So what?"" he allegedly said, when informed of the scenes. Pence would later go public about his falling out with Trump in the wake of the storming of Congress, when some rioters shouted ""hang Mike Pence"" because the vice-president refused to obstruct the certification of election results. The filing also alleges that Trump always planned to declare victory no matter the result, and laid the groundwork for this long before election day. It also accuses him of knowingly spreading false claims about the vote that he himself deemed ""crazy"". Mr Smith also provides several new details about the Trump campaign's alleged role in sowing chaos in battleground states, where a large number of mail-in ballots were being counted in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, Michigan, when a large batch of ballots seemed to be in favour of Biden, a Trump campaign operative allegedly told his colleague to ""find a reason"" that something was wrong with the ballots to give him ""options to file litigation"". The filing also claims that Trump and his allies, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, sought to ""exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol"" on 6 January 2021 to delay the election certification. They allegedly did this by calling senators and leaving voicemails that asked them to object to the state electors. Trump said on Wednesday that the case would end with his ""complete victory"".

Review ofOn Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal, by Naomi Klein (Simon & Schuster, 2019). The main value of reading Naomi Klein’s collected essays written between 2010 and 2019 inOn Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Dealis that it allows us to see how Klein and much of the climate left’s thinking has evolved over the past decade, from the debacle in Copenhagen in 2009 to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey’s Green New Deal resolution in 2019. Ten years is a really long time in the climate fight. If we’re honest, those ten years have largely been wasted. Emissions hit arecord highin 2018, and itappears2019 will be even higher. As long as emissions keep rising, we are still losing. If we’re going to start winning, the next ten years must look very different. The most exciting part of reading this collection is the clear sense of a marked political shift over the last few years. The bulk of the chapters read as an onslaught of disasters — the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Trump’s election, summer vacations marred by apocalyptic smoke — occasionally punctuated by glimmers of hope: the Vatican’s encyclical that argued for better planetary stewardship, the radical “Leap Manifesto” building a case for climate justice, and scientific pronouncements declaring the need for revolutionary economic changes. Yet these early chapters were written in a political context where the climate movement was still grasping for what a winning strategy would look like. In the context of failure, Klein rightly disposes of false solutions like capital-led geo-engineering schemes or lifestyle changes. But what a winning strategy looks like was not always clear. It is only in the essays written in 2018 and 2019 where Klein’s writing starts to coalesce around a larger political shift toward “a democratic eco-socialist vision, connecting the dots between the economic depredations caused by decades of neoliberal ascendency and the ravaged state of the natural world.” It is this broader movement that Klein suggests gives us a chance: “In the nick of time, a new political path to safety is presenting itself . . . it’s the moment to get the hell on that path.” What has changed in these recent years? Obviously one aspect is the “game changer of the Green New Deal” that inspires the title of this collection. But, as many have pointed out, the Green New Deal (GND) is not new. Klein herself says, “This kind of ‘climate justice’ framework . . . has been attempted locally for many years.” I would argue this political shift is a product of a broader awakening to the nature of the struggle itself: climate change is a class struggle — that is, it is a struggle to build mass social power to confront some of the wealthiest and most powerful sectors of capital in world history. We have understood this enemy for a while, but only recently have we begun to realize how we might build the kind of power capable of challenging them. In the ebb and flow of power between the capitalist and working classes, we are clearly in an ebb. The nineteenth and early twentieth century cycled between sputtering and growing working-class movements that built confidence through strikes and victories until finally exploding to win generalized working-class power during the original New Deal period. This power — working-class power — erected a framework of trade unions, progressive tax structures, and a welfare state to secure real gains for most workers throughout the middle of the twentieth century. We all know what happened next. Starting in the 1970s, capital struck back – and restored its power through a “free market” agenda of austerity, tax cuts, deregulation, and union-busting. FromNo LogoandThe Shock Doctrineonwards — before she began writing on climate change — Klein’s writings have always been crystal clear that we are fighting a wider political project she calls the “global neoliberal revolution.” Although working class and environmental politics are often thought of as separate, both forms of politics face the same enemy: capital. Historically, only mass working-class organization has proven capable of challenging capital on the scale needed. This is why Jane McAlevey persuasivelyarguesthat the only way to win a Green New Deal is to organize working-class power once again. One could also argue that the most significant environmental victories of the twentieth century in the US – the environmental regulatory state behind the Clean Air and Water Acts and the Environmental Protection Agency — came at a time where that working-class power was still relatively strong. As long as we are losing this larger class struggle, we are also losing the climate struggle. It isn’t difficult to make the case that climate change is a class issue. First, for Marxists, class is foremost about winning social power over material production. Under capitalism, that power is wielded by private owners seeking profit.Most emissionscan be traced back to production for profit, whether it’s the fossil-fuel industry that still legally digs up fossil fuels and sells them for profit or the wider set of capitalists that burns those fossil fuels (investor-owned electric utilities, chemicals, cement, steel). Even the emissions attached to our consumption are provisioned by for-profit producers who wield far more power over these supply chains than us. Put simply, class struggle means forcing these producers to stop what they’re doing — and subject the production of energy to more democratic and public criteria in the face of a planetary emergency. Second, climate change is a class struggle because it centers on the material conditions that working-class people face in their daily lives. It is about how we move, eat, power, and heat our homes. The lie of mainstream climate policy is not only that solutions meanworse lives, but also that the crisis as it is often expressed, in “parts per million” or degrees of warming, is difficult to understand. The GND rightly centers on sectors like housing, energy, food, and transport, and claims we can both decarbonize and decommodify these sectors to createbetter livesfor the vast majority of people. As Klein puts it, the GND is about building “an irresistible story of the future, connecting the dots among the many parts of daily life that stand to be transformed, from health care to employment, day care to jail cell, clean air to leisure time.” These demands for health care as a human right, a job guarantee, and more free time are the basics of any traditional working-class political program. Klein argues this program will naturally “raise an army of supporters” — even among those who might think climate change is a “hoax”: “If it’s a hoax that creates good jobs . . . who really cares?” So why did it take the climate movement and the Left so long to figure this out? Two reasons. First, we need to be honest about the narrow class basis of climate politics over the last several decades. Again, Klein points out that the GND simply restates what climate justice advocates have long called for. But she admits this movement was hindered by its size: “Only the relatively small ‘climate justice’ wing of the movement focused its attention on the kind of economy and society we wanted instead.” This wing focuses attention on two poles of the climate crisis: the wealthy populations most responsible for emissions and the poor, marginalized “frontline” communities forced to bear the brunt of the consequences. Why is the climate justice wing of the movement “relatively small”? Overall, this wing formed a relatively narrow class base within what we could call the climate justice coalition. On the one hand, this coalition was largely made up of the highly educated professional class climate activists who still dominate the movement: academics, scientists, journalists, nonprofit and government workers. As I recentlyargued inCatalyst, professional-class environmental politics not only represents a relatively affluent minority of society, but also tends to center the importance of knowledge (or belief versus denial) of the science at the core of the climate struggle. Professional-class climate advocates at best avoid the working-class, material concerns at the core of the crisis reviewed above; at worst, they actively argue for austerity through carbon taxes, caps, and a politics of less. On the other hand, the climate justice coalition is made up of what Klein and others refer to as “frontline communities” — small farmers, indigenous communities, and small island communities among many others. Yet these communities are defined by their marginalized status and do not constitute what we could call a “mass base” for climate struggle. To be clear: we must center frontline communities in a twenty-first-century movement against climate change. But they must be part of a broader mass movement that also includes the segment of society with the social power to prevent the disasters they face. The GND coalition includes these frontline communities and the climate justice coalition, but it also aims to expand its popular base in the working class. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez herselfclaimsto be building “a mass movement of working-class people.” The working-class GND coalition doesn’t just focus on believing the science — it also offers a program meant to appeal to the vast majority of society dealing with debt, stagnating wages, and job insecurity. AOC and Markey’sresolutionguarantees “all people of the United States . . . a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security.” Frontline communities face direct threats to their livelihood through climate disasters, but the GND program addresses the daily working-class disasters of market constraints over access to basic necessities like food, transport, housing, and energy — again, the very sectors at the core of the crisis. Klein cites a slogan of the Yellow Vest movement in France: “The government cares about the end of the world . . . we care about the end of the month.” She argues that GND politics means we don’t have to choose. Appealing to these “end of the month” struggles can help build the mass base we need to stop the end of the world. The GND program aims to mobilize a core reason the working class is itself asource of poweragainst the capitalist class: although divided in myriad ways, it represents the majority of society. The GND aims to organize the working class into a popular massto take state powerand embark on the kind of revolutionary changes the science says are necessary. The second explanation for why it took so long to build a working-class climate politics is a problem Klein confronts head on: “We’ve been trained to only see our issues in silos.” Since the 1970s, the very moment when capital began to win back power, the Left —including ecosocialists— argued it would win by abandoning traditional class-based strategies in favor of a “movement of movements” into a radical diverse whole. It is a strange phenomenon where the Left insists environmental politics is a non-class “new social movement” while the Right mobilizes naked class-based arguments against all forms of environmental policy, in the name of economic competitiveness and the American standard of living. Who is currently winning this struggle? The “movement of movements” approach is surely the impulse Klein and others had when writing the “Leap Manifesto” by including a “cross section of movements: labor, climate, faith, Indigenous, migrant, women, antipoverty, anti-incarceration, food justice, housing rights, transit and green tech.” This is precisely the right basis of a mass working-class coalition. But just because the organizing model aims to build working-class power does not guarantee this coalition will actually do so. The GND has the potential to bring that coalition together. Since theprotestsagainst the World Trade Organization in Seattle in 1999, the Left has always struggled with how to translate these diverse movements into real power. Klein is aware of this throughout the book. She argues that to build “counterpower sufficiently robust to win” requires “strengthening the threads tying together our various issues and movements”; she argues repeatedly that we need to “connect the dots.” We should not see “class” as simply one of the many strands in our “movement of movements”; rather, class politics is a powerful dot connector. It aims to tie the threads together to make clear our movements face a common enemy, the capitalist class, and struggle for goals based on our common humanity: desires for dignity, freedom, and a livable planet. This is not to say that building working-class power requires papering over the very real differences that divide many movements and the working class itself – or simply that universal social programs like “Medicare for All” are all we need to win. But it does mean that building solidarity is a process of unifying the working class around a common political project of fighting capitalism. We will not build power by simply morally validating individual movements, or assuming single-issue movements will add up to a unified force on their own that is powerful enough to take on climate change and capitalism as a whole. Klein’s book is a valuable history of a ten-year journey to a potentially transformative climate politics. If we spend the next ten years strategically focused on winning the climate struggle through the organization of working-class power, we might have a chance. Klein’s final sentences of the book beautifully convey a message of working-class solidarity through a movement for a GND: “It’s a vision that says that all of us, combined, make up the fabric of society. And, when the future of life is at stake, there’s nothing we can’t achieve.” Matt Huber is assistant professor of geography at Syracuse University.

The Guardian,Women will decide this election – and Trump keeps insulting them | Arwa Mahdawi,"Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.Trump has a very weird way of wooing womenSuburban women can be so ungrateful.Donald Trump saved your damn neighbourhood, OK? He’s saving your house. He’s saving your community. He fixed yourdishwashers. He’s keeping your crime way down. And he’s getting your husbands back to work! But despite this unhinged, and racism-tinged, list of imaginary accomplishments – which Trump trots out at every rally – suburban women areturning their backson the president. Biden leads by 23 points among suburban women in swing states, according torecent polls,and by 19 points among suburban women overall, according to Pew Research.This is a big problem for Trump. Fifty-three per cent of white women voted for him in 2016; white women in battleground states like Pennsylvania helpedusher him to victory, now they could lose him the election. Biden is currently beating Trump by6.7 points in Pennsylvania, largely because the president has lost the support of white women. (It should be noted that while there are plenty of non-white women in the suburbs, Suburban Women tends to be code for white women – Trump certainly uses it that way.)Trump can’t seem to figure out why on earth theSuburban Housewives of America, who he tweets incessantly about, aren’t keen on him. Nor can he figure out a coherent strategy to get them back: like an abusive ex-boyfriend, he’s been veering between angry threats and pathetic groveling, demanding that women appreciate all he’s done for them. “Suburban women, will you please like me?” Trump bellowed at a recent rally in Pennsylvania. “Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?”That isn’t all he’s done for women, apparently. At a rally on Tuesday, Trumpboastedthat he’s “getting your husbands back to work”. This would be a condescending thing to say in any context, but it’s particularly infuriating when women have had to leave the workforce at a greater rate than men due to the pandemic. In September, 865,000 women left the US workforce,four times more than men.It’s also a little strange that Trump doesn’t seem to think women work, considering his own daughter, Ivanka, wrote a book called Women Who Work where she drops pearls of wisdom like “women who work are real”. Something not everyone realised before Ivanka pointed it out.Ivanka, it should be said, has certainly been working hard for her father’s campaign lately. Over the last few weeks she’s beenparachuting into battleground statesacross the country to woo suburban women with her peerless Stepford charm. She’s recitedfun facts about ice-creamin Milwaukee (“I learned that the first ice-cream sundae was created in this amazing state!”) She’s posted cute photos ofdoughnuts in Michigan. She’s tweeted articles about women’s empowerment and promised to help kids and parents. Except, you know, the545 childrenseparated from their parents at the US-Mexico border, who she’s stayed pretty quiet about.After years ofbeing vagueabout her position on abortion, Ivanka has also come out as being “unapologetically” anti-abortion. In an interview withReal Clear Politicson Thursday, Ivanka seemed to suggest that her choosing to have children made her realize other people should be forced to give birth. “I respect all sides,” Ivanka said when asked about abortion, “but I am also a mother of three children, and parenthood affected me in a profound way in terms of how I think about these things.”I’m not entirely sure how Ivanka coming out as anti-abortion is supposed to help Trump win back women. Most people in America donot have extremist viewsabout abortion, after all. Rather, the sudden clarification of her abortion stance seems to be a last-ditch effort to drum up support among white Catholics, who havecooled on Trump a bit. With Biden leading in the polls and the election around the corner it seems like the Trump campaign is getting desperate; throwing whatever they can against the wall and hoping something sticks.Things don’t look good for Trump at the moment but, if 2016 taught us anything, it’s to take the polls with a pinch of salt and not get complacent. Please Suburban Women, I’m begging you, don’t mess it up this time.The supreme court to hear LGBTQ right caseAmy Coney Barrett was confirmed to thesupreme court on Tuesday, meaning there is now a 6-3 conservative supermajority. We’re going to find out very quickly what this means for LBGTQ rights.

Breitbart,"ATR: Taxes on Fuel, Business, Medicines, and More in ‘Inflation Reduction Act’","Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) has listed several taxes in in the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” that passed the Senate on Sunday — which Democrats now hail as a “climate” bill, since the Congressional Budget Offices says it will hardly reduce inflation. These taxes include taxes on fossil fuel, which will raise energy costs for working-class families, still struggling with high gas prices; taxes on businesses that will affect consumers and entrepreneurs; taxes on medicines; and taxes that affect pensions. Notably, President Joe Bidenpromisedthat the bill will “bring down family energy bills by an average of $500 a year” and that he would not tax those earning less than $400,000 per year. ATR’s analysis suggests that he will violate both promises. The full list, as published by ATR, is summarized below. ATR also notes that the billadds$80 billion, and 87,000 new staff members, to the Internal Revenue Service — and there is no guarantee that they will simply focus on wealthy tax evaders rather than auditing ordinary Americans with lower incomes.

It was used by rioters ahead of the 6 January attack to mobilize other “patriots” to “help storm the Capitol”, with some on the message board debating which politicians to kill once they got inside.In the aftermath of the riot, users continued to post content fomenting violence, including maps of government buildings to target and combat techniques for a proposed civil war.It wasn’t the first time the platform had been linked to acts of violence. Its predecessor site, 8chan, was linked to a series of white nationalist terrorist attacks, including the massacres inChristchurch, New Zealand, andEl Paso, Texas.8kun has faced significant hurdles to remain online since at least 2019, when theEl Paso attackoccurred. All websites are kept online by a network of services including web hosts and domain name registrars. 8kun has had a loyal internet provider in the Washington state-based VanwaTech, whose CEO has repeatedly defended its connections to the hate site in the name of freedom of speech.8kun was used by rioters ahead of the 6 January attack to mobilize other ‘patriots’ to ‘help storm the Capitol’.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/ReutersBut the site cannot function without platform protection services that prevent DDoS attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks, and few providers have been willing to work with it.Following its removal from the infrastructure company Cloudflare, 8kun, throughVanwaTech, worked with the Oregon-based CNServers LLC for DDoS protection. That company, too,cut tieswith 8kun when it was alerted to the site’s violent history.Since October 2020, 8kun had received DDoS protection from DDoS-Guard, a company that provides protection to a number of controversial websites, including the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer. 8kun’s ties to DDoS-Guard were first reported by the security researcher and journalistBrian Krebs.This week, DDoS-Guard became the latest company to cut ties with 8kun’s hosting company, VanwaTech, following inquiries from the Guardian.Read more:Related:Far-right website 8kun again loses internet service protection following Capitol attack10.25pmGMTReport: New York prosecutors met with former Trump attorney Michael CohenProsecutors asked Michel Cohen, the president’s former attorney and fixer, questions about his business dealings and Trump’s relationship with his longtime creditor Deutsche Bank, the Associated Press reports:New York prosecutors conducted an hours-long interview on Thursday withMichael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former attorney, asking a range of questions about the president’s business dealings, according to three people familiar with the meeting.The interview focused in part on Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank, his biggest and longest-standing creditor, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The interview, at least the second of Cohen by the Manhattan district attorney, comes amid a long-running grand jury investigation into Trump’s business dealings.District attorney Cyrus Vance Jr has been waging a protracted legal battle to get access to the president’s tax records. The US supreme court is expected to rule on Trump’s request for a stay and a further appeal after he leaves office 20 January.TheNew Yorkinvestigation is one of several legal entanglements likely to intensify as Trump loses power – and any immunity from prosecution he might have as a sitting president.The Manhattan-based grand jury has been continuing work despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has curtailed many court operations.The Republican president also faces a civil investigation, led by New York attorney general Letitia James, a Democrat, into whether his company lied about the value of its assets to get loans or tax benefits.Cohen is cooperating with that inquiry too. He previously told Congress Trump often inflated the value of his assets when dealing with lenders or potential partners, but deflated them when it benefited him for tax purposes.Read more:Related:New York prosecutors interview Michael Cohen about Trump finances10.18pmGMTUnder the Biden plan, pharmacies would also be “activated” to distribute vaccines through appointments.That prompted CVS, one of the largest chains in the country, to say it was ready to distribute 1 million shots per day through 10,000 locations. Biden also said states would have more transparent tools to plan for the number of doses to be delivered.Biden’s administration also needs to approve new vaccines to solve supply shortages and improve supply chains for the personal protective equipment health workers need to safely do their jobs. Gloves, for example, have been in short supply for months.To solve these shortages Biden pledged to use the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to direct private suppliers to produce goods, in order to make protection gear, vaccines and vaccination supplies.Another major challenge of the vaccination effort has been convincing Americans to take them, as Trump has sown misinformation and confusion throughout the pandemic. Biden said his administration would undertake “a massive public education campaign” and increase transparency to help Americans understand the vaccine.Importantly, Biden also called on Americans to “mask up” for 100 days, an effort he said could save 50,000 lives if Americans universally commit to wearing face coverings. In spite of the new B117 variant, scientists believe human behavior remains the most powerful tool to bend the curve of new infections.“Our administration will lead with science and scientists,” said Biden.Updatedat 11.25pm GMT10.16pmGMTA closer look at Joe Biden's vaccine planTo successfully roll out the most complex and logistically challenging vaccine campaign in the nation’s history, Biden’s administration seeks to confront vaccine hesitancy, a burned-out workforce, a lack of clear information on vaccine distribution and vaccine demand that far outstrips supply.“Get more people vaccinated for free,” said Biden, listing his goals. “Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people’s arms. Increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible.“This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country – but you have my word, we will manage the hell out of this operation.”Trump will leave the Biden administration with a complex, multi-layered crisis caused by the coronavirus and worsened by the Trump administration’s mishandling of it. In nearly every instance, the Trump administration sought to leave Covid-19 response to the states, distancing itself over fights for protective gear, supplies, tests and now confusion over vaccine supplies. Biden called the effort so far a “dismal failure”.Biden’s goal to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days would double the pace currently set by the Trump administration, which pledged to get 20 million people vaccinated by the end of last year. So far, only 12 million people have received shots.However, even as vaccines are rolled out, many more Americans are expected to succumb to the disease, in part because a new, more transmissible variant called B117 is expected to overtake dominant strains in the US in roughly eight weeks, and further fray health resources.“Things will get worse before they get better,” said Biden, later adding: “The policy changes we’re making will take time to show up in the Covid statistics.” It often takes weeks for infected individuals to be diagnosed, hospitalized or die from Covid-19.Biden’s incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain, said he expects Covid to claim 500,000 American lives by February, because “we haven’t fully funded the Covid response”. Already, the virus has killed more than 390,000 Americans, and left 25.7 million Americans unemployed as the economy backslides amid rising cases.Biden laid out a more ambitious, and expensive, plan to take control of the coronavirus than any undertaken by the Trump administration. One analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress called it “a sharp departure from the Trump administration’s fend-for-yourself approach”.Biden pledged to set up 100 federally funded vaccination sites at places like school gymnasiums and sports stadiums; to “staff up” the centers with “thousands” of workers; and to establish community vaccination centers in hard-to-reach and hard-hit places.“We commit to making sure communities of color, rural neighborhoods, and those living with disabilities and seniors are not left behind in our vaccination plans,” said Biden. He also called the disproportionate impacts of Covid-19 on minorities and marginalized Americans, “unacceptable, unconscionable”.Updatedat 11.27pm GMT10.00pmGMTToday so farThat’s it from me today.

Jacobin,Jacobin,"Read past the headlines, and it turns out Joe Biden’s supposed withdrawal from Afghanistan is nothing of the kind — it delays ending the war while envisioning continued “anti-terrorism” action in the future with no end in sight. President Joe Biden at the White House on April 15, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Our new issue, “Bye Bye Bidenism,” is out now.Subscribeto our print edition at a discounted rate today. In the earliest days of Joe Biden’s brief time in the White House, the new president signed a flurry of high-profile executive orders rolling back some of Trump’s most outrageous actions, and seeming to take the country in a radical new direction. Staggering the orders over days and weeks for maximum public impact, each new round of measures was greeted with wall-to-wall press coverage, usually recycling the administration’s own talking points about their boldness and transformational nature, neatly slotting into a pre-set media narrative about the country returning to “normal” under a historically, impossibly progressive new leader. It was only well after this first tidal wave of positive press, when journalists had time to really consider their fine print, talk to experts and industry representatives, or simply observe the real-world impacts that followed, that media outlets would point out theunderwhelming realityof many of the praise-chasing orders — and usually in column spaces far less-read than the initial, blaring headlines that broadcast the White House’s preferred message. This same pattern now seems to be repeating itself with this latest, much-ballyhooed announcement. While it fits with thegeneral tenorof Biden coverage up to now, the industrial-scale media flattery that’s greeted the withdrawal announcement is odd for a couple of reasons. One is that these same press outlets spent the past three yearsscreaming bloody murderwhenever Trump, in one of the handful of genuinely good things he tried to do as president, indicated he wanted to pull out of Afghanistan, including as recently as a few months ago. For years,bypassingandignoringtheadviceofmilitary commanders, especially as it related to troop withdrawals, was treated as one of Trump’smost shocking scandals; now that Biden did it, it’s suddenlybraveandrighteous. More importantly, Biden hasn’t actually declared a withdrawal from Afghanistan. That had already been negotiated and agreed to last year, when Trump, scrambling for a political win in an election year, made a deal with the Taliban to be out of the country by this May. Rather, afterdithering for months, to thefrustrationof the same generals whose opinion we were all meant to care about until last week, Biden hasdelayedending the war for another four months, before making ahigh-profile speechtaking credit for something he not only hadn’t done but was in practice actively resisting doing. Naturally, he received thesame kindofrapturous media praisethat followed, say, his immigration executive orders, sold by a supportive press as dismantling some of Trump’s most controversial measures when they actuallykept them in place. The Biden White House’s cynicism here is less important than the prospect of the United States finally ending thishideous, pointless war. Just as Trumpclaimed creditfor the painfully slow economic recovery engineered byhispredecessor, politicians do this kind of thing all the time. But for anyone who actually wants to see the United States leave the “graveyard of empires,” Biden’s delay shouldn’t be a moment for celebration. At worst, Biden is doing what so many administrations do, including the one he served as vice president in: loudly proclaiming the end of a war for political points while quietly figuring out some way to keep it going, usually throughendless delays. At best, to give himself back the time for an orderly drawdown that he lost by sitting on his hands for three months, he’s unwittingly increasing the chances the withdrawal will be scuttled. That’s not an exaggeration. Biden’s delay is an unambiguous violation of the deal Trump struck with the Taliban, and the latter aretreating it that way, threatening attacks on US troops who are still in the country past the agreed-upon deadline and refusing to attend an upcoming peace summit with the Afghan government in Turkey in response. With violence in the countryon the riseand the Talibanon the brinkof their annual spring offensive, the coming months could see a surge in attacks, military conquests, and US body bags — either the perfect pretext or a valid, urgent reason to scuttle an Afghanistan pullout entirely. Even assuming the purest motives, the administration’swarningto the Taliban that it would retaliate against any attacks on US troops makes the likelihood of a back-and-forth escalation all the greater. But even if Biden does nominally follow through on his promise to get US troops out by September, the more we read the fine print of the withdrawal, the more we have reason to worry. Unnamed “current and former American officials” have alreadytold theNew York Timesthat the Biden administration will “most likely” simply replace official US troops with spies, Special Forces, and private military contractors. Other unnamed officials havealso told the paperthe plan is to load up surrounding countries with US forces, then use drones and planes to kill suspected terrorists, the same way it does all over North Africa and the Middle East. If an invading force pulled troops out of the United States but continued bombing and sending covert forces into it, ask yourself if you’d think the war had finished. Essentially, Biden is relegating Afghanistan to the “counterterrorism-plus” formulation hedevisedunder Obama, a clever way to wage war on more countries than ever without the domestic political blowback that tends to come with full-blown invasion. As Spencer Ackermanpointed out, in his speech, Biden partly justified the pullout on the grounds that terrorism had “become more dispersed, metastasizing around the globe.” It made no sense to throw thousands of troops and billions of dollars at one country when, Biden implied, the US government should be doing that all over the world, including in Syria and Iraq. He might be wrapping up one pointless war, but Biden’s doubling down on another, much bigger one. Maybe more ominously, Biden also cited something else to justify ending the war: the need to take on China. Along with the fact thatChina hawkTony Blinkenwas reportedlythe driving forcebehind the decision to get out of Afghanistan, the announcement looks less like a dovish pivot by the most progressive government in human history, as is being sold to the public, and more like a reallocation of resources for a completely different and much more dangerous conflict. Like winter into spring, one Forever War might be ending, but a new one is set to take its place. All the indications we’re getting so far suggest Biden will continue fighting some kind of conflict in Afghanistan even once all US troops formally withdraw, however scaled down, and it’s still far from certain even that’s going to happen. Meanwhile, other signs point to the president elsewhere escalating the endless global warfare that’s done so much damage to both ordinary people around the world and their counterparts in the United States. It should be the job of the press to explain all this to the public. But you can barely hear it over the sound of the pom-poms.

Fox News,Jan. 6 Committee: Thursday's hearing will investigate Trump’s pressure campaign on DOJ,"Former Assistant Deputy Attorney General Tom Dupree gives his take on Tuesday's Jan. 6 committee hearings and its implications for former President Trump on 'Your World.' The Jan. 6 Select Committee's fifth public hearing will focus on formerPresident Donald Trump'sefforts to use the Department of Justice to overturn the 2020 election results. ""On Thursday, we hear about another part of that scheme. [Trump's] attempt to corrupt the country's top law enforcement body, the Justice Department, to support his attempt to overturn the election,"" Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said at the conclusion ofTuesday's committee hearing. The hearing is expected to feature one panel of witnesses, all former Trump DOJ officials — former Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen, former Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue and former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel. Thursday's hearing is the last expected in June, a select committee aide told Fox News. From left to right, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Rep.

Following tomorrow’s hearing, we will be holding additional hearings in the coming weeks. We will announce dates and times for those hearings soon,"" the aide said. JAN. 6 COMMITTEE HEARING: OFFICIALS DETAIL DOXXING, 'SEXUALIZED THREATS' TO FAMILIES AMID TRUMP PRESSURE The committee focused earlier this week on Trump's pressure campaign on state officials, including threats and harassment, in an attempt to force them to overturn President Joe Biden's lawful win in the weeks following the 2020 presidential election. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said that Trump's supporters issued ""sexualized threats"" to his wife and that he got a barrage of texts and emails after refusing to overturn the state's election results. Former election worker Shaye Moss testified about the ""racist"" and ""hateful"" death threats she and her mother received after Trump and Rudy Giuliani falsely accused them of smuggling ballots out of a Georgia voting center. All the officials who testified also rebutted Trump's unfounded claims the 2020 election was stolen and said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.

The other hearing featured testimony from Trump 2020 campaign aides and lawyers who said the president ignored their advice on Election Day and proceeded to push election fraud conspiracies that had no factual basis. During the first public hearing, held June 9 during primetime, the lawmakers focused on Trump's role in inciting the mob that attacked the Capitol. PENCE SAYS HE WON'T LET DEMS USE JAN. 6 TO ‘DISTRACT’ FROM THEIR ‘FAILED AGENDA,' PRAISES TRUMP RECORD Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who serves as vice chair, mentioned this week that the committee's overall investigation is still active and encouraged former Trump counsel Pat Cipollone to testify publicly. ""The American people in our hearings have heard from Bill Barr, Jeff Rosen, Richard Donohue and many others who stood up and did what is right. And they will hear more of that testimony soon. But the American people have not yet heard from Mr. Trump's former White House counsel, Pat Cipollone. Our committee is certain that Donald Trump does not want Mr. Cipollone to testify here,"" she said at the end of Tuesday's hearing, saying the committee is working on securing his testimony.

The Guardian,Universities criticised for 'tokenistic' support for Black Lives Matter,"More than 300 academics and students have criticised universities for their “tokenistic and superficial” support for the Black Lives Matter movement given their poor record on tackling institutional racism.Inan open letterto the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and higher education funding councils, regulators and representative bodies, the scholars said the sector had underestimated the prevalence of racism and failed to address its “systemic and structural nature”.The letter called out universities for publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the killing of George Floyd while racial inequalities, such as theattainment gapbetween white and black and minority ethnic (BAME) students, persist.It states: “While these and other racial inequalities remain, statements that Black lives matter can at best be regarded as tokenistic and superficial.“The sector has, to date, been overly optimistic in its assessment of the extent of the problem, it has been slow to act and, where action has been taken, it has failed to seriously engage with the systemic and structural nature of racism.”The letter, signed by leading BAME and white academics, urges the government and higher education bodies to take urgent action to ensure universities improve their efforts.The three authors of the letter – Richard Itaman, a lecturer in comparative political economy and development at King’s College London, Keston Perry, a lecturer in economics at the University of the West of England, and Angelique Golding, a business manager at Goldsmiths, University of London, – told the Guardian in a statement: “There is no clear incentive for universities to take racial justice seriously or consequences if they do not. However, there are disadvantages to us: black and minority ethnic staff leave, are not promoted and experience racism but these facts do not lead to the institution radically improving its practice.”Related:Understanding white privilege with Reni Eddo-Lodge – podcastThey propose universities provide training that substantially addresses institutional racism,white privilegeand racial micro-aggressions, such as dismissive and stereotyping comments. Research by the Guardian last yearfound most did not.The ethnicity of applicants and shortlisted and successful candidates for senior university jobs should be published, as well as a detailed breakdown of thepay gapbetween white and BAME staff. Universities should also introduce positive action schemes to train, hire and promote BAME staff to address theirunder-representation in the workforce.Another proposal is that funding bodies should make grants dependent on universities demonstrating how they are tackling racism. The sevenUK research councilsrecently revealed that white researchers are almost59% more likelyto receive research funding than their BAME peers.The letter also recommends that the government provides dedicated funding for theEquality and Human Rights Commission, which published a report onracism in higher educationlast year, to ensure that universities implement these proposals.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “Racism is abhorrent and should not be tolerated anywhere in society, including in higher education. The secretary of state has received the letter and we will respond in due course.”A spokeswoman forUniversities UK, which represents 137 higher education institutions, said: “We have called upon senior university leaders to redouble their efforts to address racial harassment. This must be a strategic priority.” She added that its advisory group to tackle racial harassment would publish recommendations in the autumn.",1,

Trump campaigned for a second term on the record of his first and focused on the failures of the Biden-Harris administration. The former president was able to point to the reversal of some of his key policies as reasons why inflation rose and the U.S. border crisis worsened. Trump faced a crowded GOP primary field, but emerged as the frontrunner yet again, easily defeating his opponents – all of whom eventually endorsed him to be the 47th President of the United States – and winning each primary contest. Vice President Kamala Harris.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Until July, Trump was running against Biden, who was seeking re-election for a second term. But the two debated for the first time in June, and weeks later, after a disastrous debate performance, Biden was pressured by Democrat insiders to suspend his presidential bid. BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP Biden made the announcement in a social media post and endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in his place, moving his vice president to the top of the ticket.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, formally accepted the GOP nomination. But Trump, just days before accepting the Republican nomination, survived an assassination attempt at a rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. During the event, Trump was showing off a chart highlighting how illegal immigration skyrocketed under the Biden-Harris administration. As he turned toward the chart, he was hit by a bullet that pierced the upper part of his right ear by the now-deceased would-be-assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks. Trump credits the chart for saving his life.

The gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, had an AK-47-style rifle pointing through the fence toward Trump as he was golfing. Trump was rushed off the golf course by U.S. Secret Service agents unharmed. TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN-HARRIS 'RHETORIC' FOR LATEST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS HE WILL 'SAVE THE COUNTRY' Just a day later, Trump told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that the ""rhetoric"" of Biden, Harris and the Democrats was to blame.

""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country – both from the inside and out."" The general election showcased two very different visions for the future of the United States of America. The Trump campaign touted pro-growth, America first economic policies, securing the border, ending inflation, and restoring ""peace through strength"" as part of the president's plan.

Meanwhile, Harris campaigned that Trump was a threat to democracy and warned supporters that he would sign a national abortion ban – something Trump repeatedly denied. As for the rhetoric, it never quite fizzled. Trump held a massive, sold-out campaign rally just a week before Election Day at Madison Square Garden in traditionally blue New York City. Democrats, including Harris, later likened Trump to ""Hitler.""

Kennedy Jr. and former Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Trump also drew support from top business leaders like Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick. Lutnick told Fox News Digital that many Wall Street leaders had privately committed their support to Trump. Trump supporters outside of Madison Square Garden.(Fox News Digital ) Trump’s victory comes after years of what his campaign called a ""weaponization"" of the Justice Department. Trump’s post-presidential life and third campaign was reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by investigations, which the former president and his allies said were just part of an effort by his political opponents to prevent him from running forre-election in 2024. Trump, who was the first president in U.S. history to be impeached and acquitted twice, was also the first president to be indicted, not just once, but four times over. TRUMP IMMUNITY CASE: SUPREME COURT RULES EX-PRESIDENTS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PROTECTION FROM PROSECUTION Just days after announcing his re-election bid in November 2022, Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland tapped former DOJ official Jack Smith as special counsel. The appointment came several months after the FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, claiming he improperly retained classified records from his presidency. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming from that probe. The case was eventually tossed completely by a federal judge in Florida, who ruled that Smith was improperly and unlawfully appointed as special counsel. Smith also took over an investigation into alleged 2020 election interference. Trump also pleaded not guilty, but his attorneys took the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court to argue on the basis of presidential immunity. Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump takes the stage with his wife Melania and son Barron to address supporters at his rally, at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., November 6, 2024.(Brian Snyder / Reuters) The high court ruled that Trump was immune from prosecution for official presidential acts, forcing Smith to file a new indictment. Trump pleaded not guilty to those new charges as well. Trump attorneys are now seeking to have the election interference charges dropped in Washington, D.C., similarly alleging that Smith was appointed unlawfully. TRUMP SAYS SUPREME COURT RULING IN COLORADO CASE IS 'UNIFYING AND INSPIRATIONAL' But that case wasn’t the first Trump-related Supreme Court ruling this election cycle. Colorado, attempting to use the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, sought to remove Trump from the 2024 primary ballot, but the Supreme Court sided unanimously with the former president, impacting efforts in several other states to do the same. In 2023, Trump was charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with allegedly falsifying business records. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges but sat through an unprecedented six-week criminal trial in New York City this spring. The jury found him guilty. Trump appealed the ruling, and the judge presiding over the case set his sentencing date for after the election. Trump also sat inside a courtroom in the fall of 2023 for a civil fraud trial stemming from a lawsuit brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Judge Arthur Engoron demanded Trump pay more than $450 million. TRUMP SAYS TAKING MUGSHOT WAS 'NOT A COMFORTABLE FEELING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG' But a New York appeals court appeared open-minded and receptive in September to reversing or reducing that judgment. Trump has also appealed a ruling to pay E. Jean Carroll more than $80 million in a defamation suit. As president, Trump said Carroll was lying about allegations of sexual assault. This year, a New York jury ruled that he defamed Carroll’s character in denying the allegations and defending himself.

He pleaded not guilty but was booked and had his mugshot taken – a photo his campaign used throughout the election cycle to illustrate the ""lawfare"" used against him. A Georgia judge tossed a number of charges against Trump, and the case is on hold. The future of the cases and charges hang in limbo, as the president-elect will have the power to pardon himself once sworn in.

The Guardian,Russian opposition figure Ilya Yashin jailed for denouncing Ukraine war,"A Russian court has sentenced the opposition politician Ilya Yashin to eight and a half years in prison, in the most high-profile case to date of a Russian dissident being jailed for opposing the invasion of Ukraine.Yashin was tried on charges of spreading false information meant to discredit the Russian army, under a law introduced after Russia launched its invasion, due to a series of posts in May about the murder and torture of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops in the town of Bucha.“Expressing hatred of the political system of the Russian Federation and realising that he is a public person … Yashin created a real threat to the formation of a negative attitude towards the armed forces of the Russian Federation,” read the verdict, which was delivered in Moscow’s Meshchansky district court.A veteran of Russia’s anti-Putin opposition, Yashin was one of a small group of vocal opponents to the war who chose not to leave the country,saying earlier this yearthat he believed that “anti-war voices sound louder and more convincing if the person remains in Russia”.In a courtroom speech this week, Yashin said: “I must remain in Russia, I must speak the truth loudly, and I must stop the bloodshed at any cost. It physically pains me to think how many people have been killed in this war, how many lives have been ruined, and how many families have lost their homes. You cannot be indifferent. And I swear I do not regret anything.”He added: “It’s better to spend 10 years behind bars as an honest man than quietly burn with shame over the blood spilled by your government.”Yashin joins a small group of other prominent dissenters who have been imprisoned for speaking out against the war.In July, a Russian city councillor wassentenced to seven years in prisonafter he spoke critically of a children’s drawing contest. “What kind of children’s drawing contest can we talk about for Children’s Day … when we have children dying every day?” he had said, the key piece of evidence against him in the trial.Vladimir Kara-Murza, anotherveteran opposition member, has also been charged with spreading false information about the army. Some media reports say he has also been charged with treason.",2,
Breitbart,Study: 1 in 4 hospitalized patients with most severe form of COVID-19 will die,"April 2 (UPI) — About 23% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 experience the most severe form of the disease and roughly one in four of them will die due to its complications, according to a study published Friday by PLOS ONE. An additional 60% suffer from the “normal” symptoms, but still have serious heart and lung complications that carry a 10% risk for death, the data showed. Collectively, COVID-19 patients in these two categories are more than seven times as likely to be hospitalized due to the illness and nearly three times as likely to die from it, compared to the 17% percent of patients with mild infections, the researchers said. “Patients do not suffer from COVID-19 in a uniform matter,” researchers from the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis wrote. “By identifying similarly affected groups, we not only improve our understanding of the disease process, but this enables us to precisely target future interventions to the highest risk patients,” they said. The findings are based on an analysis of the electronic health records of more than 7,500 COVID-19 patients from 14 hospitals in the midwestern United States and 60 primary care clinics in Minnesota. Among these patients, all of whom were diagnosed between March 7 and Aug. 25 of last year, just over 1,000 required hospital admission and were included in the study. Based on the patients’ symptoms, disease course and outcomes — recovery, hospital discharge or death — the researchers sorted them into three phenotypes, or groups, of disease severity. Of the hospitalized patients, 23% were in an “adverse” group, meaning they suffered the most severe illness. This group carried a three-fold increased risk for lung complications and seven-fold increased risk for kidney complications compared to those with more mild disease, the data showed. Most of the patients in the group had chronic health conditions, including heart and kidney disease, before infection and were more likely to be non-White and non-English speaking. Twenty-seven percent of these patients died, according to the researchers. The bulk of hospitalized patients, about 60%, experienced group II, or “normal” COVID-19 disease progression. These patients still required significant treatment — they were twice as likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit compared to those with more mild illness — and, in many cases, oxygen and ventilator support while in the hospital. The remaining 17% of patients had group III, dubbed the “favorable” category, and still were sick enough to be hospitalized but had the highest odds of recovery. Still, many of them experienced long-term symptoms following infection, as evidenced by 10% requiring readmission to the hospital following initial discharge. Basing treatment on group-specific needs could improve COVID-19 outcomes, the researchers said. Breaking down groups of patients into subgroups for treatment is “critical during a pandemic when time and resources are scarce,” the researchers wrote. This will “not only enable the identification of risk factors; they also provide essential insight towards the high yield follow up investigations,” they said.",0,
Fox News,AOC calls for the Senate to abolish the filibuster amid voting rights showdown,"Chad Pergram on GOP members pushing riot commission: 'It'll prime the pump for Democrats to alter the filibuster to pass their agenda' Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezon Wednesday re-upped her calls for theSenateto eliminate the legislative filibuster so Democrats can pass sweeping reforms while in control of Congress and the White House. The New York Democrat voiced her support for getting rid of the 60-vote threshold in response to a tweet fromPresident Bidenon Wednesday. Biden called for the passage of major federal voting rights legislation to combat the ""all-out assault on our democracy"" as GOP-led states change their election laws. ""Abolish the filibuster,"" the progressive Squad member posted in response to Biden's tweet. BIDEN SEEMINGLY BLASTS SINEMA, MANCHIN FOR 'VOTING MORE WITH MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS' The House already passed the massive election overhaul legislation, known as H.R. 1. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he'd bring the election legislation up for a vote in the Senate later this month, which would set the stage for a big clash on whether Democrats jettison the Senate tradition of a 60-vote threshold. Tensions around the filibuster debate escalated when Republicans last week used their first legislative filibuster during the Biden presidency to block consideration of forming a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Democrats needed 10 Republicans to join them in a procedural vote to start debate on the legislation, but just six Republicans broke rank, effectively killing the commission legislation that former President Donald Trump opposes. SENATE REPUBLICANS SLAM BRAKES ON BILL TO CREATE COMMISSION PROBING CAPITOL RIOT Now Democrats want to pass their top legislative priority, the election reform bill known as the For the People Act, which would set federal standards for voting access and establish publically financed congressional elections. It's a priority for Biden, as well. Republicans are united in their opposition to the legislation, which they've panned as a federal takeover of elections. But it's not even clear that Democrats could get all 50 of their members on board to pass S.1, with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a holdout and repeat defender of the filibuster. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 20: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks at a news conference to reintroduce the Green New Deal and introduce the Civilian Climate Corps Act at the Capitol Reflecting Pool near the West Front of the U.S. Capitol Building on Tuesday, April 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)( (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)) Even Biden Tuesday issued a veiled rebuke of Manchin and Sen.

AP News,Israel supports a US proposal to extend Gaza ceasefire’s first phase. But Hamas wants Phase 2,"CAIRO (AP) — Israel’s government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of theceasefire in Gazathrough Ramadan and Passover, though Hamas has insisted on negotiating the truce’s second phase instead. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase that’s aimed at ending the war and seeing all remaining living hostages in Gaza returned home. The statement gives new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal: A ceasefire extension through Passover, or April 20. On the first day, half the hostages, alive and dead, would be released. The rest would be released if agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire. The statement said it was proposed after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got “the impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.” There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which earlier rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire’s first phase by 42 days — doubling its length — saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations. Officials from Israel and mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on starting the ceasefire’s second phase in Cairo. But Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been “no progress” before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday. Hamas did not attend, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators.  Under the ceasefire deal’sterms, fighting should not resume while negotiations are underway on phase two. Israel’s new statement says it can return to fighting “if it believes that the negotiations are ineffective,” and it noted Hamas’ refusal to accept the proposal for an extension of the first phase. However, “if Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter into negotiations on all the details of the Witkoff plan,” the statement says. Before Israel’s new statement, an Egyptian official involved in the talks spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. The official said Hamas, Qatar and Egypt wanted to continue with the existing ceasefire deal, and they rejected Israel’s proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks with a release of hostages every Saturday without officially entering negotiations on the second phase. The Egyptian official said the U.S. wants to start negotiations on the second phase but called for hostage releases during the negotiations. Hamas insisted on a full implementation of the ceasefire terms. Thefirst phase, which paused 15 months of fighting in Gaza, saw therelease of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of people returned home to northern Gaza, aid into the territory increased and Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones. Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children. According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead. The two sides agreed to thethree-phase ceasefire dealin January. Talks on the second phase were meant to start the first week of February. Israelis rallied Saturday night to urge their government to continue the deal. Hamas has reaffirmed its “full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details” and called on the international community to pressure Israel to immediately proceed to the second phase. Other challenges complicate the ceasefire’s future. Israel has said Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war.Netanyahuhas also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas’ main rival, Fatah. Hamas leader Mohamed Darwish on Saturday reiterated the group is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian national consensus government or an Egypt-proposed body of technocrats not aligned with Hamas or Fatah. His comments came in an open letter to next week’s summit of Arab leaders in Cairo. Hamas has dismissed Israel’s suggestion that its leadership go into exile. In Gaza’s southern city of Rafah, AP video showed a long table set for the breaking of the day’s Ramadan fast, snaking through the ruins and lit by strings of lights as the sky darkened. War-weary Palestinians marked the first day of the holy month with fasting and more worries. “Today there is a lot of goodness, but there is no money,” said Huda Matar about the skyrocketing prices, even though more food and other staples are available compared with last year. “May God have mercy on us and restore reconstruction quickly,” said Rafah resident Fatima Abu Helal. Netanyahu’s office said last week that mediators were “also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.” The U.N. food agency said on social media it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal’s first phase. “The ceasefire must hold,” the World Food Program said. “There can be no going back.” Hamas published video footage Saturday showing a group of hostages, including two brothers embracing before one of them was released from Gaza. The video, filmed under duress, was likely taken before Feb. 15, when Iair Horn was released and left his brother, Eitan, behind. The faces of what appear to be other hostages are blurred. “I am very happy that my brother will be released tomorrow, but this is not logical in any way to separate families,” Eitan says. “Sign the second and third phase. enough of war.” ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

The Guardian,The extreme politics that drove Donald Trump to a decisive victory | Letters,"Rafael Behr warns against relying on the cautionary lessons of the 1930s to address the current rise of far-right and nationalist politics (Left, right, Harris, Trump: all prisoners of political nostalgia in an era few understand, 5 November). Yet it is only by looking at the past that we can avoid repeating its mistakes. Yes, the 1930s shouldn’t be used as a stick to beat current-day nationalist supporters as deplorables. But it is more than helpful to study the source of their appeal in the 1920s and 1930s, and what was successful in countering them then.On the source, the Weimar Republic’s lack of margin to deliver substantial economic benefits to voters because of war debts and the 1929 financial crash (an early version of “there is no alternative”) combined with the enabling of the Nazis by big businesses and mainstream conservatives to protect them against rising support for the far left. Today, we can see the same mistakes being repeated all over the western world but, as we digest the US election result, what about the tech bros supporting Donald Trump or the willingness of mainstream Republicans to enable him?On countering their appeal, the only successful electoral strategy in the 1930s was Léon Blum’s popular front of far-left and centre-left parties in France. The lessons to counter the far right are many but, as an example, it points to why Spain and Portugal have been the most successful European polities at countering the far right. They also suggest that if Keir Starmer’s government doesn’t deliver tangible economic results, and continues to isolate the far left, we can expect a major political breakthrough by Reform at the next UK election.Patrick CostelloBrussels, Belgium• Rafael Behr is quite right to note the problem of using “analogue” modes for contemporary digital politics. But two areas in his piece needed more attention. The first is the idea that “self-reinforcing information silos” dominate digital platforms – a nod to Eli Pariser’s “filter bubbles”. This, ironically, appeals precisely to the vision of modern liberal democracy that Behr is warning us against – ie extreme views arise because they aren’t properly challenged. Attractive as the filter bubble model is, research has shown that the realities are far more complicated and less siloed than we may want them to be.The second area is the somewhat natural conclusion of Behr’s argument that isn’t quite made: the state of politics is due to the insufficiency of modern liberal democracy to respond, or relate, to the evolution of capitalism into its current contradictory and self-devouring form far more than the digital platforms on which politics takes place.Prof Tom GrimwoodLancaster• Rafael Behr makes many astute observations, but is surely wrong on one fundamental issue – that the growth of digital over analogue political communication, beset as it is by echo chambers, trolling, misinformation and manipulation, is a matter of politics and economics, not technology. It is a consequence of the failed regulation of the tech giants that command these systems. Exacerbated by unprecedented inequality, the deep resentments and anger that result in such abominations as Donald Trump’s victory are not a reflection of a digital shift alone.Peter GoldingNewcastle upon Tyne• Mr Behr tries out some pretty big and intriguing ideas in a very small space. Perhaps he would have been better off waiting 24 hours and then he could have written – I told you so. It strikes me that the disaster in Spain is a microcosm and reality check on the state of politics, whether you see it as a revival of rightwing tropes or not.In Valencia, the political model, “it is what we say it is”, came up against a reality that was totally predictable. Result, a complete catastrophe and needless loss of life. This model is being run across the world – in Putin’s Russia, in Italy and now, it seems, on a mega scale in the US. Surely it is a truism that the only defence against this deranged magical thinking is the parliamentary democratic process. Vladimir Putin has eviscerated it, Donald Trump has engineered his triumph by gerrymandering it in full sight. Philosophy and acres of journalistic soul-searching will not defend us or reverse this.Neil BlackshawAlnwick,Northumberland• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

The Guardian,Republican civil war: what's the party’s future after the US Capitol attack?,"The motives that drove a pro-Donald Trump mob to attack Congress last Wednesday ranged from hazy toproudly hateful. But the actions of certain ambitious Republican officeholders in the days leading up to the tragedy were not clouded by confusion.Trump may have lost the election, but his movement was on the march, and for politicians hoping someday to succeed Trump as president, that meant an opportunity was afoot.Related:From Charlottesville to the Capitol: how rightwing impunity fueled the pro-Trump mobWith Trump now finally accepting he will leave office, the future leadership of his movement is increasingly up for grabs, with a ragtag band of senators, congressman, Trump family members – and Trump himself – already jostling for the position.Whether anyone apart from the president is able to successfully ride the tiger of racism, nihilism and grievance politics that carried Trump to near-re-election after four years of American chaos and hundreds of thousands of preventable pandemic deaths is an open question.It also might be an irrelevant question, if Trump decides to stage a 2023-24 stadium tour doubling as a new presidential campaign.“Absent disqualification, the 2024 GOP presidential nomination remains his if he wants it,”tweetedDave Wasserman, Congress editor of the Cook Political Report.But with Trump gone, for the moment, after years of rock-like reign over the Republican party, powerful currents of political ambition and realignment have swirled into the vacuum.Longtime Trump loyalists, chief among them the vice-president, Mike Pence, have suddenly broken with the president over his fight to reverse the election result. Mick Mulvaney, the former chief of staff and special envoy to Northern Ireland whoseloyalty helpedTrump escape conviction in the impeachment scandal, resigned over the Capitol riot debacle, saying: “I can’t do it. I can’t stay.”Two firebrand conservative senators, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, went the other direction, taking up Trump’s cause – only to see their campaign result almost immediately in the death of a police officer and four others, and the vandalization of the US Capitol.A third young senator with designs on the presidency, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, blasted his plotting colleagues “who, for political advantage, were giving false hope to their supporters”, he said. The Republican old guard, meanwhile, in the guise of Mitt Romney, who has actually run for president – twice –accusedhis colleagues of being “complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy”.Even the former Republican House speaker John Boehner, who since his 2015 retirement has mostly limited his commentary on politics totweeted picturesof himself mowing his lawn, said the Grand Old party (GOP) was in trouble.“I once said the party of Lincoln and Reagan is off taking a nap,” Boehnerwroteon Thursday. “The nap has become a nightmare for our nation. The GOP must awaken.”For certain Republicans, the violent and deadly near-sacking of the Capitol on Wednesday by white supremacists and other Trump sympathizers seemed to be only the second most disturbing event of the week.The night before, Republicans had lost two runoff US senate elections in Georgia, a state that until 2020 had not voted for a Democrat for president for 30 years. The two Georgia losses meant that Republicans lost control of the Senate – and leader Mitch McConnell lost his majority.“Emotions [are] running high among McConnell-aligned Republicans,” National Journal columnist Josh Kraushaar reported, “after [the] reality of what transpired in Georgia settled in. May be the heat of the moment, but mood is for declaring war on Team Trump.”A former McConnell chief of staff and campaign manager, Josh Holmes, was quick to knock down the idea.“A lot of emotions. People are angry,” Holmes replied on Twitter to Kraushaar. “Nobody is declaring war on anything. We’ll get through this.”But even the people with money, whose interests McConnell has expertly defended, grew agitated at the mess Trump had made.“This is sedition and should be treated as such,” Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, an influential business trade group,said. “The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy.” The chiefs of multiple Wall Street banks echoed the sentiment.That is not even to mention the cavalcade of Republicans who had long since broken with Trump, who piled on the president after the Capitol was sacked. The conservative columnist George Willsaid: “The three repulsive architects of Wednesday’s heartbreaking spectacle” – Trump, Hawley and Cruz – “will each wear the scarlet ‘S’ of sedition.” The conservative National Journaldeclared: “Trump must pay.” Matt Drudge’s websiteran the sarcastic banner“Thanks, Donald”. The National Reviewhailed“Trump’s final insult”. A second former Trump chief of staff, John Kelly, joined those calling for his immediate removal from office.The Republican cross-currents do not mean that the party will not find direction in time to win back the Senate, plus the House, in 2022 – or to win the presidency in 2024, whether with Trump’s name on the ticket or tattooed on the nominee’s forehead.But Trump’s role in the party, and the politics, has never been to introduce order, except when that means that everybody falls behind him. For now, everybody is doing the opposite: falling out.",2,
Breitbart,Dr. Anthony Fauci: ‘Of Course’ I Would Prescribe Chloroquine to Coronavirus Patients,"Appearing Tuesday on Philadelphia’s AM 990 The Answer Radio, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he would certainly prescribe Chloroquine to coronavirus-stricken patients in the wake of testimonies stating it could treat the deadly disease. (Listen from 52:20) A partial transcript is as follows: CHRIS STIGALL:If you’re a doctor listening to me right now and a patient with coronavirus feels like they want to try [Chloroquine] and you’re their doctor, you’re not Anthony Fauci the guy running the coronavirus task force, would you say ‘alright, we’ll give it a whirl’? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI:Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. You want to give them hope. In fact, for physicians in this country,these drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They’re anti-malaria drugs and they’re drugs against certain autoimmune diseases, like lupus. Physicians throughout the country can prescribe that in an off-label way. Which means they can write it for something it was not originally approved for. People do that all the time, and it really is an individual choice between the physician and his or her patient as to whether or not they want to do that. Despite Fauci’s remarks, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D)signedan emergency hours later order banning the use ofchloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus.

The Guardian,"Hamas and Israel have agreed Gaza ceasefire deal, Qatari PM says","Hamas and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire deal, pausing the war in Gaza and designed to broker an end to the brutal 15-month conflict, the mediator Qatar has said. The agreement is set to be officially accepted by Israel after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.The announcement on Wednesday night from Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, was made after weeks of negotiations in the Qatari capital, Doha. There were intensified efforts in recent days to hammer out the final details afterincreased pressure on Israel to reach a deal from the US president-elect, Donald Trump, which Sheikh Mohammed acknowledged in a media conference.“The two belligerents in the Gaza Strip have reached a deal on the prisoner and the hostage swap, and [the mediators] announce a ceasefire in the hopes of reaching a permanent ceasefire between the two sides,” he said.Related:‘A stern message’: how return of Trump loomed over Gaza ceasefire negotiations“Both parties should commit totally to all three phrases [of the agreement] to steer away from further bloodshed and from escalation in the region.” Sheikh Mohammed added: “We hope this will be the end of a dark chapter of war.”Medics in Gaza reported that 32 people had been killed in Israeli strikes, most in Gaza city, late on Wednesday after the deal was announced. Strikes continued early on Thursday and destroyed houses in Rafah in the south, Nuseirat in central Gaza and in northern Gaza, residents said. Israel’s military made no immediate comment and there were no reports of Hamas attacks on Israel after the ceasefire announcement.After the agreement was revealed by Qatar, the US president Joe Biden said that his administration negotiated the deal but that Trump’s team will soon be charged with making sure it is implemented. The incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the White House’s Middle East adviser Brett McGurk as the talks came to fruition in Doha, Biden said.“For the past few days, we have been speaking as one team,” Biden said.Late on Wednesday, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke separately to Biden and Trump to thank them for helping to secure the deal, his office said.“The prime minister thanked President-elect Trump for his help in advancing the release of the hostages,” Netanyahu’s office said in a first acknowledgement of a deal, adding that the two agreed to meet “soon” in Washington. The statement said Netanyahu then spoke with Biden.Hamas announced a few hours earlier that it had formally accepted the terms of the deal.In a statement later on Wednesday, the group’s acting chief, Khalil al-Hayya, said that “Israel failed to achieve its goals in Gaza.”“On behalf of all the victims, every drop of blood spilt and every tear of pain and oppression, we say: We will not forget, and we will not forgive,” he added.Related:Gaza ceasefire deal: what we know so farEven as Israeli airstrikes continued, in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the strip, people gathered to celebrate, cheering and dancing on dark streets without power. “Praise be to God, we will be free to live like human beings again soon,” a displaced father of four, Mohammed Azaiza, said.In Tel Aviv, the mood was more sombre, as protesters in favour of a deal gathered in a demonstration held to remind Israel’s leaders of their position before the cabinet vote.Maoz Inon, an Israeli peace activist whose parents were killed in the Hamas attack in October 2023 that triggered the war on 7 October, told Al Jazeera: “It’s too late for my parents and thousands of people in Gaza and thousands of Israelis but this is what I’ve been calling for … a deal and the beginning of a peace process. I am happy for all those who will sleep well tonight and go back to their families.”A first batch of 33 hostages is expected to be released on Sunday in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, and wounded people in Gaza will be allowed to leave for medical treatment.Children, women, including female soldiers, and the over-50s would be freed first, Sheikh Mohammed said. In exchange, Israel would release “a number of Palestinians”. Associated Press reported that 50 Palestinians would be released for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas and 30 for each of the other hostages.In a social media post, Trump claimed he was responsible for the breakthrough in the talks, saying the deal “could have only happened as a result of our historic victory in November, as it signalled to the entire world that my administration would seek peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our allies”.As anticipation of a ceasefire agreement rose earlier on Wednesday, Netanyahu and his defence minister, Israel Katz, met one of the leading far-right figures in the coalition, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. Smotrich has been highly critical of earlier proposed deals with Hamas. His fellow hardline minister Itamar Ben Gvir had asked him to join forces and pull their parties out of the coalition – potentially causing the government to fall – if the deal was agreed.According to an Israeli television report, Smotrich presented Netanyahu with a list of conditions for his support, including a pledge to go back to war if Hamas emerges from the ruins still in control of the Gaza Strip, and to strictly limit the quantity of humanitarian aid allowed in. Israeli media widely reported on Wednesday that the country’s decision-makers were prepared to resume hostilities after the end of the first six-week-long phase.Related:‘Thank God’: Palestinians express joy over Israel-Hamas ceasefire dealThe deal finalised in Doha largely follows the contours of a truce agreement first set out in May last year.All fighting is to pause during the first phase, and Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza’s cities to a buffer zone along the edge of the strip, the details of which are to be laid out in maps both sides have now signed off.About 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes, and should be allowed to move freely between the south and north of the territory, which Israel has cut in half by installing a military corridor.An increased flow of aid is supposed to be allowed into Gaza, though the details of how much assistance is unclear.The second phase is designed to be more comprehensive, with the remaining living hostages sent back and a corresponding ratio of Palestinian prisoners freed, alongside a complete Israeli withdrawal from the strip. That is a step Netanyahu had been very reluctant to take until now, and the specifics of this second stage is subject to further negotiations, which are due to start 16 days into the first phase.The third phase would address the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and Hamas members, and a reconstruction plan for Gaza would be launched. Arrangements for future governance of the strip remain hazy.A group representing some of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas during the warwelcomed the deal, but called for “a framework that ensures the return of every person held captive”.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement: “ This agreement marks a crucial step, but it must be carried through to completion in all its stages. We will not rest until we see the last hostage back home.”More than 15 months of war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and laid waste to most of Gaza’s infrastructure. The international court of justice is studying claims that Israel has committed genocide.About 1,200 Israelis were killed on 7 October 2023, and another 250 taken hostage. One hundred were freed in exchange for 240 women and children held in Israeli jails in a ceasefire deal struck in November 2023 thatcollapsed after a week.",1,

The retired Lockheed engineer has until recently been a lifelong Atlantan, is a veteran of two wars, and is old enough to remember when Republicans were rare inGeorgia.Related:Trump says mixing Haley with Pelosi and Biden with Obama was tactic, not gaffe“Well, yes, I think they’re both healthy,” Stovall said, when asked at the Church at Wieuca in Buckhead about the mental fitness for office of PresidentJoe Bidenand former presidentDonald Trump. “I’m a Republican, but I’m not going to vote for Trump, if I can help it. I hate to say this, but I think he was a traitor to the country onJanuary 6.“Biden? I’ve been really impressed with him on everything except the border thing. But yeah, I think Biden is a good man. If he got mental lapses … goodness, most of us do when you get a few years on you.”Buckhead, an affluent neighborhood of Atlanta, is split between Republicans and Democrats. Georgia is often described as a politically purple state, with strong Democrats and strong Republicans competing to be seen in nearly equal numbers – though spaces where they cohabitate are scarce.So when a special prosecutor at the Department of Justice released a report last week alleging striking gaps inBiden’s memory and mental acuity,political pundits jumped to assess how the issue of age will affect the American presidential election in places like this. But in the US, broad opinions matter much less than those of the relatively small number of persuadable voters.“Basically, you’re catering to a million voters, in a few states,” saidClarence Blalock, a political consultant in Georgia who is competing in the Democratic primary to challenge Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. The average age of voters tends to be older than the general public, he said, and any strategy questioning the competence of the president – or Donald Trump – due to age may backfire. “They may feel insulted by it. I don’t think it’s a good strategy.”Certainly, many on the right saw in the report’s accusations a confirmation of what they already believe about Biden – that he is largely a figurehead, with decisions being made by others. “I feel sorry for him,” said Chris Swindell, 68, a self-described libertarian from Marietta. “He comes out, and he’s not running the country. The people in the background are running the country.”But few will flip their votes over the age issue, Blalock said. He noted that most partisans had already decided to overlook the flaws of their own candidates.One of those is Jimmy Bennett, 67, a staunch Republican and Trump voter.“Listen, we know a lot of older people that are on the money with their mindset,” said Bennett over a slice of pie at Matthew’s Cafeteria in politically ecumenical Tucker, Georgia.“But if they start making these crazy decisions, and start doing things way off, and then you can see the degrade, then that’s the time to step in.”Only about 10% of voters in Georgia consider changing their votes for any reason at all, and no matter who is running. In 2022, despite the threats of defection by stalwart Trump supporters, the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams by about 300,000 votes out of roughly 4m ballots, but on the same day, the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock beat his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, by about 40,000 votes (and later won a runoff by about 100,000).“We’re never going to have a 60-40 election,” said Brian Robinson, a Republican strategist and political commentator here. “We wouldn’t have a 60-40 election if Biden died and people were voting for a dead person.”Nonetheless, the age issue is top of mind for Americans of both parties, he said, consistently ranking along with immigration and the economy as the main concerns voters express. In that regard, the special prosecutor’s report was a blow to the Biden campaign. “Democrats are hoping that independent voters are coming to Biden because they don’t like Trump. The [age] issue nullifies some of that Democratic advantage,” Robinson said.“The Biden campaign has, in some way, to provide optics that he’s healthy mentally and physically – and that’s a risk.”But Trump has to be careful too, Robinson said. “The Democrats are trying to create an equivalency there. [Trump] has to avoid providing Democrats with ammo showing equivalent incapacity.”That may prove difficult, given Trump’s own propensity for mental lapses – for every timeBiden confuses a Macron with a Mitterrand,Trump takes a Haley for a Pelosi– and equally advanced age: currently 81 and 77, both Biden and Trump would, if elected, be the oldest presidents ever.“I think Donald Trump is a fool and an idiot, and I think he has no mental acuity – period – because he doesn’t live in a world of reality. He lives in a fantasy world where facts are not facts,” said Jackie Goodman, 74, a fourth-generation Atlantan.For Goodman, her choice is about policy – she identifies as a pro-choice voter – and less about either man running.“I wish we could have a younger candidate who has a lot more vitality,” she admits. “But I definitely would not vote Republican – and I definitely would not vote for Trump.”Indeed, the question may be less about whether the age issue makes anyone switch their vote, but rather if it makes voters simply check out, said Blalock. Given the importance of turnout in US elections, how many Americans decide not to vote at all could prove crucial.“The idea that Biden doesn’t have it together, so I’m going to vote for Trump … I mean, do people think Trump has it together [either]?” he asked.“Or [do they] just stay home?”",2,
The Guardian,"Biden and Trump clinch nominations, sealing presidential rematch in 2024 election","Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump won primary elections in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state on Tuesday, solidifying a rematch a majority of voters aren’t looking forward to.Both men captured nearly all the votes cast so far in what had become token state primaries, along with the primary for Democrats abroad and the Republican caucus in Hawaii. Biden also won the Northern Mariana Islands primary on Tuesday morning, earning 11 delegates.Related:Divided Washington state to choose Biden or Trump: ‘Everything seems a mess right now’In Georgia, a nascent effort to register opposition to the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza could not be easily expressed with “no preference” protest votes in that state, because the ballot does not provide a way to do so. One woman in Roswell, Georgia, described voting for Representative Dean Phillips,who dropped outof the Democratic contest last week, as a substitute.“I voted a protest vote against the war in Gaza because I think it is horrible what is happening and I’m ashamed of my country right now,” said Robin Hawking, 56, a software developer. She said she is normally a Republican voter. “I’m hoping if enough people vote for not-Biden, he’ll get the message that he’s going to lose this election unless he does a ceasefire.”Uchenna Nwosu, a gynecologist, said her decision was a no-brainer.“It’s clear that I couldn’t vote for somebody who repealed women’s rights for abortion, for instance, for healthcare,” she said. “I don’t know why Trump should be in the race. I mean, that alone is a good reason. He doesn’t stand for anything that I stand for. So that’s it.”Trump ran unopposed in Georgia, though other names still appeared on the ballot, attracting a few voters.Scott Carpenter of Roswell voted for former ambassador Nikki Haley because he hated Trump, he said. He voted for Biden in 2020. “I don’t like Trump. I don’t like Biden. I just wanted a different choice,” he said.Travis Foreman, 46, an attorney in Alpharetta, said he thought Trump was good for America and expressed frustration with the Democratic party.“I don’t agree with the party and some of their core beliefs,” Foreman said, adding that he’s voted Democratic and independent during his life. “And it’s hard for me as a preacher’s kid from south Georgia to just agree with some of their core fundamental beliefs that they want me to. A whole gender ideology, movement – I just have a problem with it. I don’t mind what anyone chooses to do with their lives and how they live their lives, but don’t try to force me to accept certain things against my own principles. It just came to me that’s the No 1 issue.”defaultBiden won enough delegates in Georgia almost immediately to win the Democratic nomination, which requires 1,968 on the first ballot to win.“Four years ago, I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. Because of the American people, we won that battle, and now I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party – and our country – in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever,” he said in a statement.defaultTrump was also on track to secure the required 1,215 delegates needed for the Republican nomination.",2,
Fox News,"Kamala Harris praises BLM, says ongoing protests are 'essential' for change in US","Former Las Vegas SWAT officer John Sheahan weighs in on 'Outnumbered Overtime.' Peaceful protestsagainst racial injustice are critical for the nation's progress and help to keep law enforcement in check,Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.,said Friday. ""Nothing that we have achieved that has been about progress, in particular around civil rights, has come without a fight, and so I always am going to interpret these protests as an essential component of evolution in our country -- as an essential component or mark of a real democracy,"" the vice presidential nominee said during the NAACP's national convention. She added that protests were ""necessary"" as ""the people's voices must be heard, and it is often the people who must speak to get their government to do what it is supposed to do, but may not do naturally unless the people speak loudly -- and obviously peacefully."" Harris also praised the ""brilliance"" and ""impact"" of ""Black Lives Matter,"" which has received media praise but also come under fire for promoting left-wing stances like opposing the nuclear family. ""I actually believe that 'Black Lives Matter' has been the most significant agent for change within the criminal justice system,"" she said. HERSCHEL WALKER APPLAUDS BIDEN OVER LOUISVILLE VIOLENCE RESPONSE, CHALLENGES HARRIS Her comments came during mass protests surrounding the deaths of Black Americans like Breonna Taylor, whose case prompted a series of demonstrations earlier this week. While the vast majority of demonstrations -- which began in late May -- have been peaceful, some have resulted in property destruction. Footage quickly emerged purportedly showing buildings vandalized and burned in Louisville, Ky., after a grand jury decided to indict just one of the officers involved in Taylor's death. Across the country, violent confrontations during these demonstrations have led to deaths and injuries, including for demonstrators, journalists and police officers. In Louisville, Kentucky, two officers were shot, and subsequently hospitalized, during protests surrounding Taylor's case. Former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats have been criticized for allegedly not doing enough to denounce violent demonstrations, while President's Trump campaign has attempted to tie their statements to on-going riots. FLASHBACK: KAMALA HARRIS SAID NATIONWIDE PROTESTS ARE 'NOT GOING TO STOP' In May, Biden released a statement in which he distinguished between violent and peaceful protests. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not,” thestatement read. At the end of last month, Sen. Harris similarlysaid: ""We must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder. Make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice.""",0,
BBC News,Science Park says it adds Â£50m into economy,"Exeter Science Park says it is generating Â£50m for the local economy and for the first time in its 10-year history, is balancing the books financially. Previously, it had required additional funding to remain viableas it struggled to repay council loans. The site is owned by Exeter City Council, The University of Exeter, East Devon District Council and Devon County Council and was established to support growth in STEMM businesses (science, technology, engineering, maths and medicines) and to create employment. The ""not for profit"" organisation said it had 45 businesses and 750 workers based at the East Devon site, despite only 25% of the park having been completed. Dr Sally Basker, CEO of the Science Park, said: ""We have a robust balance sheet and we are now well placed for the next phrase of growth. ""The challenge for a tiny science park is attracting people and firms. You want to get to a point of critical mass, where it goes from being nice to be at the science park, to people want to be here, to then we need to be here. ""We are are the 'want' stage. It's about creating a destination. It's not just about offices and laboratories. It's the community. ""We have a new hotel, we'd love to see a gym here, so we are building a community, not just for the closed science park but one where we engage with the local area and parish."" Exeter Science Park predicted it would complete its construction by the end of the late 2030s and it believed by then, about 3,500 people would work on the site. It said those firms and business would be generating Â£350m to the local and regional economy. The park said the next phase is to simplify its planning and development arrangements, which will help it seek new sources of investment to help the park grow over coming years, and continue to enhance its contribution to the region's economy.

BBC News,Gaza ceasefire deal reached by Israel and Hamas,"Israel and Hamas have agreed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal following 15 months of war, mediators Qatar and the US say. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani said the agreement would come into effect on Sunday so long as it was approved by the Israeli cabinet. US President Joe Biden said it would ""halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal's final details were still being worked on, but he thanked Biden for ""promoting"" it. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya said it was the result of Palestinian ""resilience"". Many Palestinians and Israeli hostages' families celebrated the news, but there was no let up in the war on the ground in Gaza. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported Israeli air strikes killed more than 20 people following the Qatari announcement. They included 12 people who were living in a residential block in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City, it said.  There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to a struggle to get aid to those in need. Israel says 94 of the hostages are still being held by Hamas, of whom 34 are presumed dead. In addition, there are four Israelis who were abducted before the war, two of whom are dead. Follow live updates on Gaza ceasefire deal Watch: Qatar PM announces Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal Qatar's prime minister called for ""calm"" on both sides before the start of the first six-week phase of the ceasefire deal, which he said would see 33 hostages - including women, children and elderly people - exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israeli forces will also withdraw to the east away from densely populated areas of Gaza, displaced Palestinians will be allowed to begin returning to their homes and hundreds of aid lorries will be allowed into the territory each day. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a return to ""sustainable calm"" - will start on the 16th day. The third and final stage will involve the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years - and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies. Israel's cabinet has to meet on Thursday morning to give its final approval. The ceasefire and the release of the first three Israeli hostages is expected to come on Sunday although a senior Hamas official has told the BBC there are talks ongoing to bring the start forward to Thursday night. Sheikh Mohammed said there was ""a clear mechanism to negotiate phase two and three"", with the agreements set to be published ""in the next couple of days, once the details are finalised"". He also said Qatar, the US and Egypt, which also helped broker the deal, would work together to ensure Israel and Hamas fulfilled their obligations. ""We hope that this will be the last page of the war, and we hope that all parties will commit to implementing all the terms of this agreement,"" he added. President Biden said the plan, which he first outlined eight months ago, was ""the result not only of the extreme pressure Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and the weakening of Iran - but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy"". ""Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas's 7 October attack, and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed,"" a statement added. ""It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin."" At a later news conference, Biden also acknowledged the assistance of President-elect Donald Trump, who put pressure on both parties by demanding hostages be released before his inauguration on Monday. ""In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team,"" he said, noting that most of the implementation of the deal would happen after he left office. Trump was first to confirm reports the agreement had been reached, beating the White House and Qatar to a formal announcement. In a later post on social media, he attempted to take the credit for the ""epic"" agreement, saying it ""could have only happened as a result of our historic victory in November"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office thanked Trump ""for his help in promoting the release of the hostages, and for helping Israel end the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families"". ""The prime minister made it clear that he is committed to returning all the hostages by any means necessary,"" it said, before adding that he had also thanked Biden. Later, the office said an official statement from Netanyahu would ""be issued only after the completion of the final details of the agreement, which are being worked on at present"". Israel's President, Isaac Herzog, said the deal would bring with it ""deeply painful"" moments and ""present significant challenges"", but that it was ""the right move"". The agreement is expected to be approved by the Israeli cabinet, possibly as soon as Thursday morning, despite opposition from Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. Then the names of all the Palestinian prisoners due for release will be made public by the Israeli government, and the families of any victims will be given 48 hours to appeal. Some of the prisoners are serving life sentences after being convicted of murder and terrorism. Hamas's chief negotiator and acting Gaza chief, Khalil al-Hayya, said the agreement represented ""a milestone in the conflict with the enemy, on the path to achieving our people's goals of liberation and return"". The group, he added, would now seek to ""rebuild Gaza again, alleviate the pain, heal the wounds"". But he also warned ""we will not forget, and we will not forgive"" the suffering inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza. As news of the agreement emerged, pictures showed people cheering and waving Palestinian flags in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah and southern city of Khan Younis. Sanabel, a 17-year-old girl living to the north in Gaza City, told BBC OS: ""All of us are delighted."" ""We have been waiting for this for a long time,"" she said. ""Finally, I will put my head on my pillow without worrying... It is time to heal."" Nawara al-Najjar, whose husband was among more than 70 people killed when Israeli forces launched an operation to rescue two hostages, said: ""After the ceasefire I want to give my children the best life."" ""I want them to get over the fear we lived. My children are really scared. The terror has settled in their hearts."" Sharone Lifschitz is a British-Israeli woman whose 84-year-old father Oded is among the remaining hostages. Her mother, Yocheved, was also abducted in the 7 October attack but was released after several weeks in captivity. She told the BBC in London as news of the deal came through that it felt ""like a bit of sanity"", but she admitted: ""I know that the chances for my dad are very slim."" ""He's an elderly man, but miracles do happen. My mum did come back, and one way or another, we will know. We will know if he's still with us, if we can look after him."" She warned: ""There are more graves to come and traumatised people to come back, but we will look after them and make them see light again... May this be the start of something better."" Moshe Lavi, the brother in-law of Omri Miran, a 47-year-old father-of-two young children, told the BBC that it was ""a very mixed day for most families of hostages"". ""We want to see our families come home from their mass captivity. But we also understand that this is a phase deal. Only the first phase was agreed upon,"" he said. ""We'll have to keep fighting, keep advocating as families with all leaders with our own government to understand they have to release all the hostages."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the ""priority now must be to ease the tremendous suffering caused by this conflict"".",2,
BBC News,Businesses under Budget black cloud - chamber,"Businesses in Shropshire are being squeezed from the aftermath of the Budget with a ""black cloud"" hanging over employers, according to the latest findings by the Shropshire Chamber of Commerce. Tax increases, employment rules and rising inflation were impacting business owners, the chamber's quarterly survey revealed. Nearly three quarters of the firms that responded said they expected to increase prices over the next three months â a rise of 16% on the previous quarter. The Treasurysaid it was delivering the stability businesses neededto invest and grow. Business owners were asked about sales forecasts, international trade, recruitment, training, cashflow, and confidence levels, the chamber said, and one of the biggest concerns was the rise in employer National Insurance contributions next month. Rosie Beswick, policy analyst for the chamber, said: ""It is abundantly clear from the results of this survey that businesses across the county are feeling squeezed from several directions right now. ""The November Budget still hangs over them like a black cloud, and is causing worry for many â 73% said the chancellor's decisions were now having a negative impact on their business. ""Increased taxes such as April's upcoming rise in employer National Insurance are blunting recruitment, and stalling investment. And the introduction of further employment rules is adding to employers' woes."" The rate of companies looking to invest in plant and machinery fell by 11%, and there was a 7% fall in employers planning to invest in training in the coming months, the chamber said. The survey also revealed a fall in both current sales and future orders, and a 5% reduction on companies seeking to take on staff. Last month a survey of UK employers carried out by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) reported companies were planning to cut jobs or recruit fewer people ahead of the National Insurance rises. Chief executive of the chamber Ruth Ross said: ""It is clear that there is a very challenging year ahead for many businesses in the county.""

Haley listens to 10-year-old Hannah Kesselering during a campaign stop in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, on Tuesday.(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Haley is also blasting Trump on her social media page on X. After Trump falsely claimed this week that Democrats could vote on Tuesday in the New Hampshire Republican primary, she fired back. ""Another reason we need to move on from Trump: too many lies. Democrats can't vote in the NH primary. They haven't been able to change their registration for months,"" Haley posted. The Trump campaign, responding, pointed to Haley's third place finish in Iowa, far behind Trump and narrowly behind FloridaGov. Ron DeSantis. ""After her embarrassing third place finish in Iowa, Nikki Haley is getting desperate as she realizes using money from Democrat donors and trying to appeal to Democrat voters is no way to win a Republican primary,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt argued in a comment to Fox News. Haley has repeatedly argued all week that it is a two-person race in New Hampshire, with DeSantis a distant third in the single digits in public opinion surveys. However, the big question is whether Haley's increased attacks on Trump, and her hustling on the campaign trail, can help her close the gap with the former president.

The Guardian,Fani Willis disqualified from prosecuting Trump in Georgia election case,"The Fulton county district attorney,Fani Willis, has been disqualified from prosecutingDonald Trumpover his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in light of her relationship with her top deputy on the case, theGeorgiastate court of appeals ruled on Thursday.The 2-1 decision to remove Willis – and overturn the ruling by the presiding judge that allowed her to remain on the case as long as the deputy, Nathan Wade, resigned – likely signals the death knell for the final criminal case still active against Trump.“After carefully considering the trial court’s findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office,” Judge Trenton Brownwrote in the 31-page opinion.“The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring.“While we recognize that an appearance of impropriety is generally not enough to support disqualification, this is the rare case in which disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.”Hours after the decision, the district attorney’s office filed a notice announcing its intention to appeal the ruling to the Georgia supreme court. But Trump’s return to the White House will cause proceedings to be paused for the duration of his presidency, suggesting the case may not continue in its current form.Trumpwas charged alongside more than a dozen associateslast year with racketeering over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. As part of their bid to dismiss the case, Trump and his co-defendants alleged Willis’s relationship meant she should be recused from the case.The initial effort to have Willis disqualified failed after the Fulton county superior court judge Scott McAfee decided, following days of contentious evidentiary hearings, that Trump and his co-defendants did not prove an actual conflict of interest.McAfee nonetheless ruled that Willis’s relationship with Wade gave the appearance of a conflict, which needed to be addressed. For Willis to continue bringing the case, he ordered, Wade needed to resign from the district attorney’s office. Waderesigned later that evening.Willisvehemently denied wrongdoingwhen she testified at the evidentiary hearings last February, rebutting accusations that her relationship with Wade affected the charges and scope of the case and insisting that there was no conflict of interest.The district attorney testified that her relationship with Wade started months after she hired him to work on the case as a special prosecutor and ended in summer of 2023, around the time that a grand jury in Atlanta returned the racketeering indictment against Trump.Willis also sought to undercut allegations that she had engaged in a sort of kickback scheme through Wade’s hiring in which she benefited from his earnings, as alleged by defense lawyers for a co-defendant of Trump, Michael Roman. She testified that she reimbursed any expenses he incurred.The allegations first surfaced last January in a motion filed by Roman’s lawyer, Ashleigh Merchant, who complained about a potential conflict of interest arising from what she described as “self-dealing” between Willis and Wade as a result of their then unconfirmed romantic relationship.Roman’s filing, in essence, accused Willis of engaging in a quasi-kickback scheme, in which Wade paid for joint vacations to Florida and California using earnings of more than $650,000 from working on the Trump case. The filing also alleged the relationship had started before he was hired.",2,
AP News,Environment solution: New metals refinery for nickel and cobalt opens in Ohio,"In a step forward for efforts to acquire the metals crucial to addressing climate change, on Monday a new plant that can extract nickel and cobalt from scrap material opens in Fairfield, Ohio. The resulting metals will be used in new batteries and other clean energy markets. Extracting metals out of old material avoids the environmental damage of open pit mining and prevents the metals from ending up in the landfill. Many see this as the future, even if it takes decades to become reality. Climate change islargely caused by burning dirty fuelsfor two broad purposes: to make electricity and to move vehicles.Batteriescan substitute for both much of the time, butthis changeoveris still in its infancy and the need for more minerals is great. The metals refining company Nth Cycle builds systems that yield nickel and cobalt from a form of shredded lithium ion batteries and nickel scrap from electric vehicles and consumer electronics. There are a growing number of companies, including Redwood Materials and Li-Cycle, that are expanding the young U.S. battery recycling industry. Currently, even when battery materials are collected for recycling in the U.S., they’re mostly shipped overseas to be refined. Building a traditional metals refinery in the U.S. could cost upward of $1 billion, but Nth Cycle uses a modular design it says is ideal because it can be added onto existing manufacturing facilities. “We have no refining capacity in the U.S. at all for these types of materials,” said Megan O’Connor, CEO of Nth Cycle. “We will be the first commercial cobalt nickel refinery in the U.S., which we’re very excited about.”  Some experts heralded the development. “I think it’s very encouraging to hear the scaling has reached a stage where this is a possible revenue-making business,” said Shirley Meng, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Craig Arnold, engineering professor and university innovation officer at Princeton University, said this type of advancement is “huge” for the industry. “If we had a stronger domestic supply of these critical materials, it would absolutely benefit the battery industry,” he said. Right now the only U.S. source of nickel is the Eagle Mine in Michigan. Ore mined there is shipped internationally for refining. The demand for critical minerals for battery usage is surging as the world becomes more electrified. The need for nickel for electric vehicles grew nearly 30% in 2023 over the year before, according to theInternational Energy Agency. EV battery demand for cobalt increased 15% in the same period. Critical minerals are currently extracted from the Earth from mines in Australia, Indonesia, Congo and Brazil, among other countries. The supply chain is complex, involving an international matrix of labor rights concerns,tribal land conflictsandenvironmental damage. China is the dominant player in minerals crucial to the energy transition and also leads in battery recycling. The supply chain can be shaken by geopolitical conflict and also emits carbon emissions as materials are transported from country to country. This puts U.S. battery ambitions at risk, which is why experts say carrying out more of these processes domestically will make it easier to reach sustainability goals. The Inflation Reduction Act is incentivizing the expansion of the battery supply chain in the U.S. and Nth Cycle received $7.2 million under the law’s Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit (48C) program. The IRA alsooffers credits for EV’scontaining battery materials and components from the U.S. or a country that has a free trade agreement with the U.S. The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The Guardian,Is the spectre of inflation finally fading – and what could it mean for Biden?,"For the last three years, the US and Europe have struggled with a specter unseen for a generation – inflation. Now it looks like the phantom may finally be fading.This week the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of England allheld interest ratessteady and cautiously signaled that the fight to tamp down soaring prices may be coming to an end.Related:Biden plans to use cold-war era law in attempt to lower US prices“We’re seeing inflation making real progress. These are the things we have been wanting to see,” the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said on Wednesday after announcing the central bank would once again pause rate rises.The Fed went as far as to signal that it was considering three cuts in 2024 to its benchmark interest rates – which have shot up from near zero in 2020 to a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% as Powell has fought to bring inflation under control.Having initially dismissed the rising prices as a “transitory” phase triggered by the supply chain disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic, Powell has remained cautious even as inflation has steadily fallen. “We can’t know. We still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory. That would be premature,” he said on Wednesday.Investors were less circumspect. After the news the Dow Jones hit a new record high, closing above 37,000 for the first time.In Europe, there was also – qualified – good news about inflation as the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would hold rates steady. The ECB cut its inflation predictions for 2024 and removed the phrase “inflation is expected to remain too high for too long” used in previous statements.While the Eurozone’s inflation rate hasnow fallenfrom over 9% to close to the ECB’s target of 2%, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said the central bank had not even discussed rate cuts for next year. “Should we lower our guard? We asked ourselves that. No – we should absolutely not lower our guard,” she said.But the rate pause – the second in a row – suggests Lagarde is hopeful that the worst is over.In the UK – where inflation has fallen from over 10% to 4.6% – the economic picture looks bleaker. The Bank of England warned there was still a long way to go compared with the US and EU. “Relative to developments in the United States and the euro area, measures of wage inflation were considerably higher in the United Kingdom and services price inflation had fallen back by far less,” the bank said in a statement.For all the caveats it does appear that central bankers are hopeful that the worst of the inflation cycle is behind us. And in the US at least the economy has proven to be remarkably resilient despite the generational shock to its system delivered by Covid-19.US inflation topped 9% in 2022 and has since fallen to 3.1%. Hiring has remained robust since the mass layoffs of the pandemic. Shoppers have continued to shop. Retail sales in November were far higher than economists had expected and gloomy predictions that consumers would stop shopping have so far proven wrong.Powell has frequently mentioned that he hopes the US can achieve a “soft landing” – where the rate rises cool the economy and bring down prices without triggering a recession. So far it appears the Fed is on course to do just that.If he succeeds it may go some way to solving another US economic conundrum: if the economy is OK why doesn’t anyone believe it?Pollafter poll shows Americans believe the economy is a mess.Those beliefs are a major stumbling block for Joe Biden who has put “Bidenomics” – his economic record – on the ballot. Inflation has consistently sunk the political fortunes of politicians. “Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman,” as Ronald Reagan noted, a president elected during another period of frightening price rises. If this deeply unstabilizing phenomenon is finally under control, maybe Biden won’t get mugged.",2,
Jacobin,Jacobin,"After a four-day refusal to teach in-person, the Chicago Teachers Union is going back to school on Wednesday, where they wanted to be all along. The city’s lackluster pandemic safety made that impossible. Teacher Stuart Abram holds a sign in support of the Chicago Teachers Union, January 5, 2022. (John J. Kim /Chicago Tribune/ Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Our new issue, “Bye Bye Bidenism,” is out now.Subscribeto our print edition at a discounted rate today. Sinceearlyin the pandemic, both Republican- and Democratic-leaning pundits have portrayed virtual school as an educational disaster for students, an economic disaster for the country, and a political disaster for Democrats. They’ve also united in blaming teachers’ unions,ratherthan the pandemic and the government’sfailedresponse to it, for school districts’ decisions to go virtual. This narrative waned as schools across the country returned to in-person instruction in 2021. However, teachers union-bashing has returned with a vengeance in the past few weeks, as the omicron variant infects record numbers of students and staff members. Some school districts have retreated to virtual learningdueto studentabsencesand lack ofstaff, andlittlelearningis happening in many that remain open. In only one case has a union action been central to the shift back to virtual learning. Before returning to in-person after the holiday break, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU)called forexpanded COVID testing, a request that Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker reportedlyofferedto help implement. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, instead chose last week tolock outteachers. The standoff continued, until yesterday, when the two sides reached an agreement to reopen school on Wednesday. Predictably, anti-union pundits have blamed the CTU for having the temerity to ask for safety procedures that alreadyexistin many other districts. BothYahoo NewsWhite House correspondentAlexander NazaryanandNational JournalcolumnistJosh Kraushaarcalled on President Joe Biden to break the CTUlikeRonald Reaganbrokethe Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization in 1981. FiveThirtyEightfounder Nate Silver went further,declaringthat virtual school has been a bigger disaster than the Iraq War, which killed as many as1 millionpeople. While Silver’s comment triggered widespreadcriticismfor its absurdity, it wasn’t far from whatmanyelite opponents of virtual learning havesaidformonths. For example,New Yorkmagazine’s Jonathan Chait, a longtimecriticof teachers’ unions,wrotein March — when COVID hadalreadykilled half a million Americans — that virtual school was the “gravest catastrophe” of the pandemic. Every piece of the pundits’ narrative has been flawed from the start — especially the blame placed on teachers’ unions. Because while many of these anti-union voices claim they’re speaking for poor families and families of color, both polling and actual enrollmentdecisionsdirectly rebut their claims. Since the beginning of the pandemic, preference for distance versus in-person schoolinghasbeenstronglycorrelatedwith race and income. Last October, a YouGovpollfound that both African Americans and Latinos supported schools going remote by nearly two to one. Only white people, by a small margin, opposed the shift. Income was similarly correlated, with lower-income respondents more supportive of virtual learning than upper-income ones. Anti-union pundits have also claimed they’re trying to save Democrats from electoral disaster. Yet polling throughout the pandemic has revealed that most families are happy with how their local schools have handled COVID. A MarchChalkbeatpollrevealedthat 75 percent of parents were getting the type of instruction they wanted, with 15 percent wanting more in-person and 10 percent wanting more virtual. More recently, a November Ipsospollfound that 71 percent of overall respondents and 75 percent of parents thought their local schools were doing a “very good” or “somewhat good” job of balancing health and safety with other priorities. With national polling failing to prove their case,punditstried another tack: theyseized onthe Virginia gubernatorial election results, where Democrat Terry McAuliffe lost a close race to Republican Glenn Youngkin. The fact that McAuliffe ran a dreadful campaignfocusedontying Youngkin to Donald Trump — and that Youngkin barely mentioned virtual schooling during his campaign, preferring to stoke fears about “critical race theory” — was irrelevant. Bizarrely, some pundits went so far as to cite Youngkin’s lack of attention to virtual school as proof of its centrality. “Youngkin, the unlikely governor-elect of Virginia, didn’t talk about school closures on his way to defeating McAuliffe,” Nazaryanwrote. “He didn’t need to.” Searching for evidence to prove unions’ threat to Democrats’ electoral prospects, the anti-union Democrats for Education Reform (DFER) created apush pollthat asked Virginians whether they agreed with thestatement, “Despite CDC guidelines about safe school reopenings, Terry McAuliffe and other Democrats sided with teachers unions instead of scientists and kept schools closed for in-person learning for too long. Glenn Youngkin will follow the science and oppose unnecessary shutdowns.” In an ostensible piece of straight reporting, theNew York Times’Dana Goldstein and Noam Scheiber cited this poll as a neutral source, without mentioning that DFER receives backing fromhedge funds, theWalton family, andRupert Murdoch. Left unmentioned was the reality that Virginia’s Democratic trifectamandatedfive days of in-person instruction per week for the 2021–22 school year andgavehigher raises to police than to teachers. In short, it’s not clear what more Virginia Democrats could have done to placate parents who wanted to see in-person enacted and teachers punished for their insolence. As Chris Jackson, Ipsos’s senior vice president,toldEducation Week, “If you just watched coverage of those elections, you sort of got the picture that there’s this popular revolt of parents just totally fed up with what’s going on [regarding virtual]. The data suggests that’s not true at all — that in fact, most parents are actually pretty positive about how schools have handled the pandemic.” Instead, Virginiapollsfound that critical race theory (CRT) was the most important issue for a quarter of voters. Those voters preferred Youngkin by more than two to one. Another quarter of voters said their number one issue was how schools were handling the pandemic. But those voters preferred McAuliffe by two to one. The best evidence that virtual school mattered in Virginia is astudythat suggested it swung the state by eight-tenths of a percent against McAuliffe — less than Youngkin’s margin of victory. However, the study wasn’t able to disentangle the effect of CRT and other education issues from virtual. Perhaps the biggest fallacy in the entire COVID schooling narrative is that teachers’ unions are to blame for districts shifting to virtual. Almost nowhere in the country do unionized teachers’ contracts grant them any control over whether their district offers virtual or in-person instruction. In Virginia, teachers didn’t even have collective bargaining rights in 2020 or 2021. Teachers, it seems, are to blame simply for having an opinion about their workplace. The most compelling evidence that unions have played little role in the adoption of distance instruction is that charter schools, which areoverwhelminglynonunion, havestayedvirtual at higher rates than traditional public schools. As a study by Columbia professor Sarah Cohodesfound, “charters were more likely [than traditional public schools] to offer virtual learning, both in urban and nonurban areas.” Like every other piece of discomfiting evidence, this fact scarcely pierced the elite anti-union narrative. In fact, longtime union antagonist Michael Bloombergpledgedto give $750 million to charter schools, allegedly in response to unions causing schools to go remote. Yet the charter that Bloomberg touted as the kind of school he wants to fund, New York’s Success Academy (knownfor its maltreatment of students), actually stayed virtual throughout theentire2020–21 school year, monthsafterpublic schools in the city returned to in-person instruction. The reality of the COVID schooling debate is that there’s a split within the tenuous Democratic coalition. Beyond unions, the party relies on the votes of low-income people and people of color, while simultaneously trying to woo upper-income white professionals. Were unions at odds with low-income parents, as in the famously fractious 1968 Ocean Hill-Brownsvilleconflict, Democrats might understandably be torn. But today the debate is largely between well-off white parents and everyone else. It’s only framed as a crisis because many pundits are themselves part of this group and because Democratshavespentdecades trying to make the white professional class loyal members of their party. Much like their predecessors — the neoconservatives whofondlyquotedRonald Reagan’s quip that “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me” or the white parents who said they opposedbusingnot because they opposed integration, but because they were concerned about their children’s education — some white liberals upset about remote schooling have embraced a narrative of personal political betrayal. In November, journalist Andrew RicewroteinNew Yorkmagazine, “My wife, a socially liberal professional woman, voted for the school board but left her ballot blank in the race for governor. She had sworn to me that she would never cast a vote for [Democrat] Phil Murphy again after our son spent the majority of last school year learning in our dining room.” Last week, Cleveland-based writer Angie Schmittlamented in theAtlantic, “Until recently, I was a loyal, left-leaning Democrat, and I had been my entire adult life…. But because of what my family has gone through during the pandemic, I can’t muster the same enthusiasm. I feel adrift from my tribe and, to a certain degree, disgusted with both parties.” Yet if anything, Schmitt is out of step with other parents in the Cleveland district, which is 65 percent black, 17 percent Latino, and 15 percent white. As the74reportedlast February, “school district surveys have repeatedly shown a majority of parents uneasy with returning to school.” Whenaskedby the district about their preference, families’ top choice was virtual schooling, followed by hybrid, and then full-time in-person. The district also experienced an enrollment drop in in-person charters and a hugeincreasein enrollment in virtual charters. The one element of the virtual debate that doesn’t collapse under scrutiny is the contention that in-person education is more effective for most students. Few teachers would disagree with such a claim. All things equal, in-person instruction is clearly preferable to remote learning. However, even here, the rhetoric has become totally untethered from reality. Astudyby Brown University economist Emily Oster — whose data hasbeencriticizedas invalid and who has received funding from several billionaire donors — claims that the difference between a full year of virtual and a full year of in-person schooling was approximately 10 percentage points in a district’s math passing rate and four points in its English passing rate. However, passing rates plummeted across the country, regardless of whether schools were in-person or virtual — hardly surprising given the stress of the pandemic, students’ own illnesses, and the stunningfactthat more than 1.5 million children have lost a caregiver during the pandemic. Complicating things further, Oster’s research showed that, in some states, virtual districts outperformed in-person districts. Moreover, swings of five or even ten points in passing ratesoccurredpre-pandemic, especially when measured at the districtlevel. If we really want to help students recover academically from the pandemic, we know how to do it. The first step is getting the pandemic under control. The second is providing families with the tools to weather the pandemic’s effects, such as paid leave, free health care, and generous financial support.Studyafterstudyhasshownthat everything from minimum wage increases to SNAP benefits to a universal basic income can dramatically improve educational outcomes. One study found that simply upping students’ calorie intake on testing days boosted math pass rates by 11 percent and English pass rates by 6 percent — a more significant effect than Oster claimed to find between a year of fully virtual school and a year of fully in-person school. Within the classroom, thebestevidenceis that intensive tutoringis“one of the few school-based interventions with demonstrated large positive effects on both math and reading achievement.” However, intensive tutoringisn’t cheap. It takes the political will to fund it. Crucially, the ability of schools to help students academically will depend on attracting andretaininggood teachers and staff members. But schools —particularlyhigh-poverty ones —werealreadyhavingtroublefilling open positionsbeforethe latest round of teacher-bashing, and research has found that teachers are workinglongerhoursduring the pandemic, are morestressedout than the average worker, and are facingburnout, with many consideringleavingthe profession. Do pundits really believe that calling teacherslazy and selfishfor theirreasonableconcerns about workplace safety, or slamming unions, whichboostteacher pay and make it a more attractive occupation, is likely to attract morehigh-quality teachers? Making matters worse, because standardized test scores are aflawedbasis for evaluating both student learning and teacher quality, it will be impossible to disentangle the effects of the pandemic from the effects of attrition on teacher quality in the years to come. Ironically, many of the studies cited to show the ruinous effects of virtual schooling serve to underscore just how underpaid US teachers are relative to their importance. The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Budget Modelclaimsthat adding one month of in-person instruction to public schools would increase long-run GDP in the United States by $1 trillion. That means that each of the country’s3.2 millionfull-time public school teachers generate over $300,000 in economic benefit for the country per month — approximately five times theaveragepublic school teacher’s salary for the entire year. One doesn’t need to buy Wharton’s extravagant estimates to see the disconnect here. Anti-union pundits seem to think that in-person education is crucial both socially and economically. Yet when it comes toactually investingin public education — including in teachers’ compensation — these pundits would rather bash unions. When confronted with this discrepancy,SilverandOsterhave said they think teachers should receive an unspecified amount of hazard pay due to the risks of in-person instruction. That’s more than many pundits have allowed, but these passing comments pale in comparison to the strident criticism they’ve leveled at teachers for the past two years. Similarly, whilemanyDemocrats —includingvice president Kamala Harris — put forward proposals to raise teacher pay during the 2020 campaign, Democrats haven’t raised the issue since. Anyone who truly cares about making sure that students come out of the pandemic stronger than before needs to push for the social programs that families need and the funding required to attract and retain qualified teachers and staff. Neither minimizing the threat COVID poses tostudentsandworkersnor blaming teachers unions will achieve that goal. Instead, by making it more likely that students willmiss instructiondue to illness and by pushing good teachers out of the profession, it will achieve precisely the opposite.

Fox News,"'Special Report' All-Star Panel on Biden's low approval, Build Back Better, China","'Special Report's' All-Star panel serves up hot takes on Biden's low approval rating, Build Back Better, and the Biden administration's proposed diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. This is a rush transcript of ""Special Report"" on November 18, 2021. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your tax incentives for electric vehicles that would be assembled in the United States, the Canadian government says that would be a violation of the new trade agreement.JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to talk about that to some extent.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whose decision was it to break with tradition and not hold a formal press conference after the trilateral summit today?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I don't think it's as scandalous as that in terms of the back story.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should we expect a press conference tonight or tomorrow?PSAKI: I would not expect no. But you can take questions -- can you ask questions in any format, right? I don't think you need a formal, embroidered chair for it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But we would like the president.PSAKI: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Good luck with that. Don't think it's happening. It didn't happen today. Traditionally it does after that meeting with the leaders of Canada and Mexico.This as we have some new polls about the president's performance on a number of different issues. We'll put that up there. On every issue listed here, including coronavirus, underwater. There only one point, but in the most separation, look at Afghanistan, the approval of 27 percent, 63 percent disapprove. And the economy right there in the middle, approval 36 percent. These numbers have to worry the White House, Democrats, heading into obviously an election year next year.Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent of ""The Washington Examiner,"" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Bill McGurn, columnist for ""The Wall Street Journal."" Mara, it's great to have you in studio.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Thank you. Very nice to be here at this beautiful desk.BAIER: We're getting there, slowly but surely, to the panel back here. First of all, what about the press conference? It's kind of unusual.LIASSON: It's unusual. But you know what, presidents make up their own rules, and Donald Trump did it the way he wanted to. And Joe Biden did it the way he wants to.BAIER: But they have had to clean up a little bit of some of the things the president had said in recent days.LIASSON: They often have to clean up after him. But I don't know if having a press conference would make that any different. He has had one. He should have more. Look, the press corps wants him to do more. And he is going to decide what he wants. I don't think the American people really care one way or another.BAIER: What about those numbers?LIASSON: The numbers are just terrible. And what's interesting is I don't know whether people have just sorrowed on Biden and then all of the internals kind of followed that. If you don't like the job the guy is doing, of course you don't approve of what he is doing on the economy or COVID, you're not going to separate those things out. And often the specific items of a president's agenda are only as popular as he is.But it's bad. And Democrats think they can turn it around by passing their agenda and by selling it to people. We're going to see if that happens or not.BAIER: Yes, Byron, speaking of that, we will have a vote probably in the House late tonight on the Build Back Better, or the reconciliation bill, however you want to call. The CBO saying that it is going to add to the deficit if they calculate the IRS is not going to be able to get tax cheats at $400 billion. But it might add some $300 plus billion to the deficit. So it would cost something potentially.BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ""THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER"": It is odd for a bill that was not supposed to cost anything. But as far as this vote tonight or tomorrow is concerned, the public has had a chance to digest the bipartisan infrastructure bill that has been passed and been signed, and that really hasn't made any difference in the president's ratings.The ratings reflect, his job approval ratings reflect the substance of what he is doing on these issues. They don't like what he is doing on the border. They don't like inflation. They thought coronavirus should be over by now, but it's not. So all of these issues, very important issues, coronavirus being the one he really got elected for, the public is unhappy with what's going on. This is not a communications problem. This is a substance problem for the White House.BAIER: We should point out the overall approval number is 44 in our poll. But other polls have had it at 36, 37 as well. So there's the overall approval. But when you look at the vice president's approval rating, we have that at 40 percent, and you can see it ticking down from June, October, until now. She was asked about that on ABC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Polls, they go up, they go down. But I think what is most important is that we remain consistent with what we need to do to deal with the issues that we are presented with at this moment. And so let's again look at what we accomplished. It's historic in nature. At least the biggest investment in infrastructure in a generation in America.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you don't feel misused or under used?HARRIS: No, I don't. I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished. There is a lot more to do, and we are going to get it done.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Vice President Harris's communications director is not as excited, lost the job, no longer at the White House. Bill, thoughts about her answer and where she is kind of positioned?BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Yes, look, I don't think the vice president has a lot she can point to what she has done. She seems to be terrified going to the border. We saw the real border czar, the president of Mexico, not the vice president.But I will say for Kamala Harris. The Kamala Harris problem is not a Kamala Harris problem. It's a Joe Biden problem. They are looking at this. The things that Joe Biden can count as an achievement, passing his infrastructure bill or the COVID -- those are Washington achievements. People want to see improvements in their own lives. And I think what they see is not just the president going in the wrong direction but looking incredibly incompetent. Certainly, that's what we saw in Afghanistan.First, they dismissed inflation. Everyone in the administration telling us not something they should be worried about, they didn't predict it would be here at this level today. I think it's very hard to come up with an achievement, a concrete achievement that Joe Biden can point to and say because of this, Americans are better off. As Byron said, COVID is still raging. I believe more people died this year than last year. There are a lot of things he led us to believe that he was going to fix, that he was the solution. And I think a lot of people are just concluding, like Jimmy Carter, the job is just too big for him.BAIER: On the list of issues that are underwater, the second one from the bottom is China 28 percent approval. Asked about that summit, the virtual summit, we are finding more and more out about what wasn't said. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: As it relates to how we engage with China, that we see it through the prism of competition, not conflict. That is our objective. But the president is going to raise issues where he has concern, and he's going to look for areas to work together.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did he ask President Xi to specifically with this U.S. intel agency led investigation into the origin of COVID?PSAKI: Peter, it's clear that's what we want. That's what we have been pressing on.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: But, Mara, he didn't say it.LIASSON: She didn't say one way or another, but it sounds like he didn't.Look, China is going to be a huge problem for a long time, and no, we don't want a conflict with China. We don't want an armed conflict with China. But the United States and China are more and more going two separate ways. They're decoupling in some ways. But soon China is going to be the biggest economy on the globe.BAIER: The decision about the Olympics?LIASSON: Yes, that's interesting. Joe Biden said today he was open to a diplomatic boycott, which is kind of half a loaf. It means that athletes can still go, but there would be a kind of symbolic boycott from the United States government.BAIER: How does that work, Byron, a symbolic boycott of the Olympics?(LAUGHTER)YORK: It doesn't really work. Listen, I think it was stunning to learn that in a three-and-a-half hour conversation, the president did not bring up with President Xi the issue of China stonewalling an investigation into the origin of COVID. And what we are hearing today with the meetings of the leaders of Canada and Mexico, as far as Mexico is concerned the president didn't bring up the remain in Mexico issue. The White House said, well, it's under litigation, we can't really talk about it. The most important factor, really in the flow of illegal immigrants across the border is Biden's rescission of the remain in Mexico program. It doesn't even come up. So you wonder whether the president is really on the mark on some of these issues.BAIER: I mentioned earlier, Bill, that the White House has had to have a bit of a clean-up just in the past few days about some of the things President Biden has said. Now the decision not to have a press conference. The Canadian prime minister had his own press conference. What do you make about this? You have been inside White Houses.MCGURN: Well, look, it's because Joe Biden leaves a lot of question marks on things. On China you can't just solve this by having dialogue. It's great to talk about phone calls. But if you don't convey a message, I don't know what the purpose is.I think it's very unclear what Joe Biden's China policy is. It's very difficult. I think he took a good step on the submarines and the deal with Australia and so forth. But there is a lot left to do. And right now, I would say, for me the key test of a policy is does it strengthen our friends in the region like Australia and Taiwan, whom China is trying to bully, or does it weaken them? The first thing we have to do is keep our friends, keep them secure, keep them safe, and keep them strong.BAIER: But Bill, if you're in this White House, this White House now, are you saying yes, let's have this press conference? Or are you saying this president is not good at that format, he's just not good at articulating in that way, and don't have it?MCGURN: Yes. As a person that wrote speeches for a president, I don't really believe communications is ever the problem. I always believe that behind a communications problem is a substance problem. What he needs is a clear policy and one that's going to work.BAIER: Last thing quickly, Mara. If they pass this in the House, the Build Back Better, they have a long way to go in the Senate.LIASSON: They have a long way to go. Progressives failed to get the kind of commitment they wanted from Joe Manchin, and he still has the whip hand in the Senate. He is in no hurry.BAIER: No hurry. All right, panel, thank you very much. When we come back, a look at a very special night last night.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2021 VIQ Media Transcription, Inc.

AP News,House elections produced a stalemate. Can Republicans figure out how to work with a thin majority?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After one of the mostchaotic and least productive sessionsin modern history, voters made a surprising choice in elections for the U.S. House -- they overwhelmingly stuck with the status quo. House Republicans willhold onto a thin majority, and while the chamber’s exact partisan divide is still to be determined as votes are tallied in a handful of states, the results of 435 House races nationwide have produced hardly any change to the makeup of the chamber. In fact, it’s more like a stalemate: Republicans and Democrats have each flipped seven seats, while just eight incumbents nationwide have lost their races. The results show just how entrenched the political dynamics have become in a legislative chamber that is meant to closely reflect the will of the people. NeitherDonald Trump’s sweep of swing statesnor a record of two years marked byinfighting among GOP House membersseemed to weigh much on House election results. Instead, the contest for control of the chamber boiled down to just a couple dozen politically divided districts and fewer truly close races even as House candidates nationwide spent a combined $1.5 billion, according to Open Secrets, which tracks political spending. House Democratic LeaderHakeem Jeffriescalled it “bitterly disappointing” to see his party’s bid to retake the House fall short by just a few seats. But he also made sure to note, “Notwithstanding the adverse political environment that happened with a Trump wave sweeping every single battleground state in America, Democrats will actually have increased the number of seats in the new Congress.” Still, that hasn’t stopped Republican leaders from taking a victory lap and talking of a mandate to implement a conservative agenda.  “On Election Day, Americans sent a clear message to reject the consequences of Democratic control,” said Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the GOP’s House campaign committee, adding, “That’s why voters delivered House Republicans a majority and sent Donald Trump to the White House in a landslide.” Trump is on track to win the popular vote for the first time, but it will likely be a narrow victory once all ballots are counted, reflecting how politically deadlocked the country has become. In the House, the margins will also be close, particularly after Trump chose several House Republicans for roles in his administration. “Every single vote will count,” said House SpeakerMike Johnson. “Because if someone gets ill, or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane, then it affects the votes on the floor.” Johnson’s party held onto the majority largely thanks to two seats the party flipped in Pennsylvania, as well as three more that were redistricted by the GOP-controlled North Carolina General Assembly to favor their party. Democrats, meanwhile, did best in New York — Jeffries’ home state — where they flipped three seats. They also picked up two redistricted seats, in Louisiana and Alabama, that were ordered by courts to ensure fair representation for Black voters. But as the congressional map becomes clear after the latestredistricting cyclefollowing the 2020 census, some democracy advocates are concerned about the small number of House districts that are in play. While Republicans for years won more congressional seats than expected through gerrymandered districts,Democrats have battled back by shaping districtsto their advantage and essentially evened out the playing field. “The consequences are that the people’s House barely reflects the will of the people. Voters have very little possibility to shift the balance of power in the House even when their moods change,” said David Daley, who has written about gerrymandering and is a senior fellow at FairVote, an organization that advocates for voting reforms. FairVote estimates that 85% of House seats are now safe for one party — the highest percentage it has tracked in two decades. Political polarization also plays a role in that trend, and Daley said it has resulted in a dynamic where House members are less likely to work across the aisle and are more worried about facing a primary opponent who criticizes them for not being partisan enough. Several of the incumbents who lost reelection, such as Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado or Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York, were some of the most willing to work on bipartisan legislation. But now that Republicans hold the House, Senate and White House, there is little talk of working with Democrats. Instead, they hope to use a special budget process to implement partisan legislation aimed at extending tax breaks, bolstering immigration enforcement at the southern border and dismantling federal regulations. To do that, they will also have to overcome the infighting that has hampered them the last two years — and cracks are already showing in their unity. In an internal vote this week, Johnson received his party’s nomination to remain speaker when the new Congress starts Jan. 3. But lawmakers are still haggling over whether to keep in place rules that allowed a small group of conservatives to trigger the ouster of Johnson’s predecessor,former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. With a razor-thin majority, almost any Republican can block legislation from moving forward, as the conservative bloc has done periodically. “As usual, it’s going to be very difficult for Congress to get anything done,” said Rob Speel, a political science professor at Penn State Behrend. This story was first published on Nov. 16, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 18, 2024, to correct the name of an expert on gerrymandering. His name is David Daley, not David Peters.",2,

Fox News,New York Times op-ed frets primetime January 6 committee hearing will be a 'dud',"Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., criticizes the January 6 committee and Democrats' move to ‘politicize’ gun control issue. ANew York Timesopinion piece warned about ""The Anticlimax of the Jan. 6 Hearings"" on Wednesday in anticipation of Thursday’s primetime hearings. Author Jacob Bacharach claimed in his piece that the highly anticipated Jan. 6 committee hearings ""may well be a dud"" because ""[t]he modern Democratic Party has not often shown itself to be capable of transcendent political showmanship."" ""Frustrated Democratic voters have watched for years as the G.O.P. has wielded congressional hearings to great media effect while their own party clung to forms and procedures, unable and unwilling to do what was necessary to break through the noise,"" Bacharach wrote. ELISE STEFANIK SLAMS ‘ILLEGITIMATE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE AS ‘GREATEST DISTRACTION ON EARTH’ The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S. Photographer: Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images He explained that Republicans have been more successful in wielding committee hearings by using the ""admittedly and explicitly partisan""Benghazi hearingsas an example. ""The Benghazi hearings of the 2010s were an inevitable development: an admittedly and explicitly partisan affair, designed to damage Hillary Clinton. With disciplined messaging (and a mainstream press eager to avoid any suggestion of liberal bias or favoritism), Republicans were able to turn Benghazi and her use of a private email server into electoral liabilities. Though Democrats largely believed she handled herself well, her testimony hardened negative opinion of her on the right and may have served to turn some more politically disengaged voters against her as well,"" Bacharach wrote. He also claimed that the Democrats’ determination to keep theJanuary 6 committeehearings a ""sensible inquiry"" are what ultimately will produce an ""anticlimax"" event. In this Jan. 6, 2021 file photo, protesters storm the Capitol in Washington. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) ""But because Democrats — and the committee’s few cooperating Republican members — seem determined to conduct a sensible inquiry, the hearings ultimately promise an anticlimax,"" Bacharach wrote. Although Bacharach was doubtful of the hearings producing a change of opinion, he also lamented the rise of a ""factional, regional and violent"" perspective that seems to be motivating conservatives. GREG GUTFELD: THE MEDIA ATTEMPTS TO REVIVE JAN 6 TO SAVE BIDEN’S IMPLODING PRESIDENCY ""A terrifying historical counterfactual is that the only thing that might have gotten enough of the G.O.P. on board to matter would have been if the rioters had actually gone through with it, and even then, it’s hard to be sure,"" Bacharach concluded.

The Guardian,Seven people killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza City school shelter,"Seven people have been killed after an Israeli airstrike hit a school housing displaced people in western Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said, amid fears that Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis might be forgotten astensions boilbetween Hezbollah and Israel.The strike hit Kafr Qasem school in Beach camp on Sunday morning, officials in Gaza said. Among those killed was Majed Saleh, the director of the Hamas-run public works and housing ministry, they added.Israel’s military said the strike had targeted Hamas fighters and that it had used aerial surveillance and taken other steps to limit the risk to civilians.Gaza’s schools closed after the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and most have been transformed into shelters. About 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced, often multiple times.Six other Palestinians were killed in separate airstrikes in central and southern parts of Gaza, the medics said.Related:Israel strikes targets in Lebanon as Hezbollah launches deepest rocket attacks since start of Gaza war“All focus of the news and media is on Lebanon. Gaza is forgotten,” Nezar Zaqout, who is living in a tent camp in Muwasi in southern Gaza, told the Associated Press.“Every day we heard that there was hope for negotiations, or new news that they were trying to solve the issue of the displaced … but we have become completely forgotten.”Saadi Abu Mustafa told AP he feared that the escalation in fighting and the focus on Lebanon would “affect us negatively”. Hezbollah has said it is confronting Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza, and Hamas praised Hezbollah on Sunday after the Lebanese group launched overnight rocket strikes at northernIsrael.Reports persist of Israeli bombardment from the air and land causing civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of homes and other civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.Last Friday, Israeli forces killed at least 14 Palestinians in tank fire and airstrikes on northern and central areas of the Gaza Strip, medics said, as tanks advanced further into north-west Rafah, near the border with Egypt.The Israeli military says forces operating in Rafah have killed hundreds of militants, located tunnels and explosives and destroyed military infrastructure.According to Gaza’s health ministry, 70% of stockpiled medications and 83% of health supplies have been used up, forcing hospitals and healthcare facilities to suspend services.Eleven months into the Gaza war, the death toll among Palestinians has passed 41,000, according to health authorities in the territory. Most of the dead are civilians and the total is nearly 2% of Gaza’s prewar population. The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people died and about 250 were taken hostage.",1,
The Guardian,Why it matters when Black Lives Matter clothing is banned,"Formula One has banned drivers from wearing clothing bearing messages while performing official duties. The decision came after Lewis Hamilton wore a top at the Tuscan Grand Prix on 13 September that said “Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor”.Since March, celebrities have not shied away from wearing clothing in support of Black Lives Matter (BLM) at high-profile events – but not without a backlash. The Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka was told to“keep politics out of sport”when she broughtseven face masks with the names of different victims of police brutalityto the US Open. Almost 2,000 people complained to Ofcom – which has yet to decide whether to investigate – about the BLM necklace worn by Alesha Dixon on Britain’s Got Talent (only a few weeks afterthe programme received 24,500 complaints – later dismissed by the regulator – about a performance by the dance group Diversitythat was inspired by the police killing of George Floyd).The framing of these moments as radical and political rather than sincere and teachable has raised other questions, such as: are black lives allowed to matter in public spaces – public spaces that are normally the home of white privilege?This framing reaffirms the status quo of systemic racism. The fashion historian Darnell-Jamal Lisby says BLM clothes are perceived as threatening because they “shake the belief that conditioned the world to believe that white people are superior”. He says they “disrupt a system that privileges those who benefited from the oppression of black people”. As such, the wearing of BLM clothing is suppressed (as in the case of Hamilton) or heavily criticised (as Dixon experienced).Last month’s Emmys were especially powerful not only because of the number of celebrities wearing BLM clothes, but also because the intimate nature of the ceremony (with nominees filmed at home) made their clothes feel more personal than if they were on a red carpet.Sterling K Brownof This Is Us wore a dinner jacket over a T-shirt emblazoned with a BLM logo and a black power fist. Yvonne Orji, best known for Insecure, had the fist shaved into her hair. Killing Eve’sSandra Ohwore a beautiful purple jacket with “Black lives are precious” written on it in Korean.The T-shirt worn by the Watchmen writer Damon Lindelof was affecting, too. It bore the words “Remember Tulsa ’21”, which referencedthe 1921 Tulsa massacre, in which as many as 300 black residents of the city in Oklahoma were killed by white mobs. The Good Place star William Jackson Harper wore a“Good trouble” T-shirtin honour of the late civil rights leader John Lewis. Regina King and Uzo Aduba, who won awards for Watchmen and Mrs America respectively, wore shirts that honoured Breonna Taylor. King paired her T-shirt, which featured Taylor’s face, with a pink Schiaparelli suit.“As Nina Simone once said: ‘It is the duty of an artist to reflect the times,’” said the stylist duo Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald in an email. They worked on King’s outfit: “We chose pink as it is the colour of love and empathy. It is a colour of emotion and nurture.” In light of a grand jury’s decisionnotto charge officers directly with killing Taylor, the outfits are a sobering reminder of police injustice.Incidents such as a school district in Ohiobanning BLM and other slogan T-shirts for being “controversial”show that the role of the celebrity wearing BLM clothes is as important now as it was six months ago. “Being cognisant of the times is important now more than ever,” said Bannerman and McDonald. “Clothing is an outward expression of inward emotion.”The F1 has responded saying: “Lewis can wear his BLM t shirt in the paddock and before the race but like any driver it has never been allowed on the podium.”",1,
AP News,Judges hand down what could be the last punishments for the Jan. 6 riot before pardons from Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal judge who oversawDonald Trump’s 2020 election interference casedenounced efforts to rewritethe history of the U.S. Capitol attackFriday as she handed down what she acknowledged may be one of the final punishments for the Jan. 6 riot before the Republican president-elect’s promised pardons. In the courthouse within view of the Capitol days before Trump is set to take office, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan acknowledged the Virginia man she was sentencing may never actually serve his 10-day prison term for his role in the riot. But Chutkan said she would not let talk of pardons impact decisions in her courtroom, telling the defendant: “There have to be consequences.” “I only wish the rest of the country could see what I’ve seen,” Chutkan said before sentencing Brian Leo Kelly, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor offenses. She rejected the portrayal of the rioters as peaceful protesters as “nonsense,” arguing that even those who didn’t engage in violence and destruction were part of an effort to stop the peaceful transfer of power. “I know what happened,” said Chutkan, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama. “I can’t say it won’t happen again.” In the weeks since Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, the judges overseeing the more than 1,500 criminal cases against the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol have continuedaccepting guilty pleas, presiding over trialsand handing out sentences, even as some judges have alluded the fact that the largest prosecution in Justice Department history is likely nearing an abrupt end.  Nearly 1,300 of the defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a judge or jury after trials to charges including seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers with dangerous weapons. Over 1,000 of them have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds getting prison terms ranging from several days to 22 years. Trump has cast the riotersas “patriots” and “hostages”he contends have been unfairly treated by the same Justice Department that prosecuted him in two cases, which have since been dismissed. Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the violence that was captured on camera as members of the angry mob pushed past police barriers, shattered windows and attacked police with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons while Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. But the scope of the potential pardons for the Jan. 6 defendants remains unclear. Trump has said he will look at defendants on a case-by-case basis, but he has not explained how he will decide who receives such relief. Vice President-elect JD Vancerecently said: “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.” But he later added there was a “bit of gray area” in some cases. Several Jan. 6 sentencings took place Friday as Chutkan presided over the case against Kelly, who remained inside the Capitol for about 36 minutes, ignoring police commands to leave the building, according to prosecutors. Kelly, 57, of Fairfax Station, Virginia, used his cellphone to record images of the riot, “treating the unfolding events as a spectacle,”prosecutors said. Kelley’s lawyer noted in court papers that his client didn’t participate in any violence or destruction, and realized “the gravity of the situation as soon as he entered the Rotunda.” Kelly told Chutkan he was only there to support Trump — not to “uprise and go against” the government. In a different case in the courtroom next door, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta handed down a year-long prison sentence to the former general counsel for the Oath Keepers and a close associate ofthe far-right extremist group’s founderStewart Rhodes. Kelley SoRelle, 45, of Granbury Texas, pleaded guilty to obstructing justice for encouraging others to destroy electronic evidence. SoRelle was photographed outside the Capitol with Rhodes,who was sentenced to 18 years in prisonafter being convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as a violent plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power. During the riot, SoRelle posted a chat message for other Oath Keepers that said, “We are acting like the founding fathers — can’t stand down. Per Stewart, and I concur.” SoRelle’s case remained suspended for months amid questions about her mental health. She described having delusional thoughts before she was admitted to the federal Bureau of Prisons in November 2023 for a competency evaluation and released several months later. In a tearful statement to the judge, SoRelle said she deeply regrets her association with Rhodes and the Oath Keepers, and rejects anything other than following the “peaceful electoral process.” Mehta, another Obama appointee, described SoRelle’s actions as an attempt to cover up among “the most serious conduct Americans can commit: sedition.” Mehta didn’t mention the potential pardons coming under the Trump administration. But, the judge said he hoped the events of Jan. 6 will not be forgotten “anytime soon.” ___",1,

Protests have spread across the US this weekend, with many turning violent in confrontation with police and national guard forces.Paul, 23, could be seen wearing a mask and filming as the mall in Scottsdale was looted.“To be absolutely clear, neither I nor anyone in our group was engaged in any looting or vandalism,” Paul said in astatement posted to Twitter.He added in an Instagram story that police teargassed him and his companions during the protests.Paul said: “I do not condone violence, looting or breaking the law. However, I understand the anger and frustration that led to the destruction we witnessed, and while it’s not the answer, it’s important that people see it, and collectively figure out how to move forward in a healthy way.”Paul, whose brother Logan is also a YouTube star, has been involved in a number of controversies.In 2018, he was filmedusing the N-word while rapping. He was also accused of anti-social behaviour and was the subject of a number of noise complaints after moving into a house in West Hollywood.After being sued by his landlords, he relocated to another area of Los Angeles.",2,
The Guardian,Trump threatens 25% tariffs on foreign cars and semiconductor chips,"Donald Trumpstood firm against warnings that his threatened trade war risks derailing the US economy, claiming his administration could hit foreign cars with tariffs of around 25% within weeks.Semiconductor chips and drugs are set to face higher duties, Trump told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday.The White House has repeatedly raised the threat of tariffs since Trump returned to office last month, pledging to rebalance the global economic order in America’s favor.A string of announced tariffs have yet to be introduced, however, as economists and business urge the Trump administration to reconsider.Duties on imports from Canada and Mexico have beenrepeatedly delayed;modified levies on steel and aluminum, announced last week, will not be enforced until next month; and a wave of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, also trailed last week, will not kick in before April.Tariffs are taxes on foreign goods. They are paid by the importer of the product – in this case, companies and consumers based inside the US – rather than the exporter, elsewhere in the world.Related:Trump says US prices ‘could go up’ as he threatens new tariffs on trade partnersAsked on Tuesday if he had decided the rate of a threatened tariff on cars from overseas, Trump said he would “probably” announce that on 2 April, “but it’ll be in the neighborhood of 25%”.Upon being asked the same question about threatened tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, Trump replied: “It’ll be 25% and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over the course of a year.”The ramp-up, he explained, was designed to lure manufacturers to the US. “When they come into the United States, and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff.”Executives have cautioned that the administration’s plan for tariffs risks harming the US economy. A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada “will blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen”, Jim Farley, the Ford CEO, told an investor conference in New York last week.",0,

The Guardian,American Nightmare: Trump’s Breadline Kids review – ‘Nobody chooses to be poor’,"There never seems to be a programme about children in poverty, despair or crisis (if we distinguish between the three) the broadcast of which cannot be described as “timely”. That is bad enough, but American Nightmare: Trump’s Breadline Kids (Channel 4) could not be timelier. That is true on his side of the Atlantic and on ours, as the airwaves of this septic isle fill with the sound of elected officials asserting that, for good moral and economic reasons,hungry children should not be fed via the public purse.This latest instalment of the ever-reliable Dispatches series was recorded in Ohio over four months that took in the arrival of Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests that spread across the US afterthe killing of George Floyd. It follows the stories of five young people, representing different facets of poverty. Kyah, 14, and her sister Kelia, 18, along with their mother, Becky, are part of the hidden homeless population. They have been sofa surfing with friends and relatives since Covid-19 hit the job Becky was about to start and left the family without an income. Unable to pay rent, they lost their home and then, as they waited for emergency benefits to come through, their possessions. The storage facility auctioned them off to cover the fees they could not pay on time. “Nobody chooses to be poor,” explains Kyah. “Sometimes it can look like that because they give up and accept it, but I don’t think nobody would choose to live this way.” The family are sharing one room at a friend’s house.Illness pulled the rug from under the feet of 13-year-old Shawn’s family. He, his mother, Crystal, and his baby sister, Dior, have been living in a tiny trailer since his mother was diagnosed with a kidney disease and, for the first time in her life, had to stop working. The lack of space means his 15-year-old brother, Edward, lives with their grandmother. They live on $400 (£310) of food stamps and $485 in other benefits a month. Crystal works 80 hours a month at the local Salvation Army food bank to qualify for the latter (despite being too ill to work) and Covid-19 food shortages have halved the purchasing power of the former. Raised by a father who was a member of the KKK, she takes her mixed-race sons to BLM protests “so that they know what it feels like to come together”. She remembers the time their grandfather burned a cross on the front lawn as the worst moment of her life.Working-family poverty is embodied by 12-year-old Laikyen. She and her sister are, of necessity, mostly left to fend for themselves during school-free lockdown, while their mother works all hours at the local petrol station. They survive thanks to the fact that they own their home (bought with a $10,000 loan taken out in better days) and receive parcels from the local food bank. There, Laikyen – who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and was held back in kindergarten (“Because I was not smart”) – has her beloved “Miss Candy”, who sits with her and tries to create an oasis of calm in the child’s life to enable her to pay attention to schoolwork. “We’re going to get that ‘D’ up!” she assures the distressed Laikyen. “I don’t care!” she replies. “You do care,” says Miss Candy. “I care. It’s just a lot on you right now.”On it goes, illustrating deftly in an hour the innumerable life chances already absent from these children’s lives before more were stolen by the pandemic, by the president, by the lack of a sufficient safety net for people who fall.Worst of all, it is a bagatelle. These children are not the worst off. They are not long-term, “fully” homeless. They still have a cigarette paper or two separating them from the abyss.

The Guardian,‘Pandemic is not over’: ministers criticised for scrapping UK Covid surveillance,"Ministers have been accused of “turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn” after scrapping nationwide Covid surveillance programmes, with scientists saying it will almost certainly end up costing more money in the long run.Last week, scientists announced that the React study – which randomly tests about 150,000 people across England each month to see how many are infected with coronavirus – will be scrapped at the end of March, and no further data will be collected beyond that point.Funding is also being withdrawn from the Zoe covid symptom study, the Siren and Vivaldi studies (which monitor infections in health workers and care homes) and the CoMix social contacts survey, while mass free testing is due to end on 1 April.Related:Dismay as funding for UK’s ‘world-beating’ Covid trackers is axedThe Office for National Statistics’ Covid infection survey, which regularly samples the same 180,000 people to estimate what percentage of the UK populations is infected, will continue.It comes as growing numbers of new infections in multiple countries led one expert to prompt speculation that Europe could be at the start of a sixth wave of Covid infections, partly driven by the“stealth” BA.2 Omicron variant.Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said the decisions on Covid surveillance would slow the country’s ability to respond and adjust to future waves or surges of infection, making the current reliance on emergency booster programmes progressively less viable, and were at best “shortsighted”.Griffin said: “At worst, it is symptomatic of a policy-driven movement to ignore the fact that the pandemic is not over, and that we remain in a highly dynamic situation with respect to immunity versus infection and virus evolution. This is about as far from ‘following the science’ as you can get.“Losing these programmes will almost certainly end up costing more in terms of disruption than saved. It is a false economy, and yet another example of short-term thinking.”Related:Scottish health secretary calls Johnson’s plan to scrap Covid rules a ‘dead cat’Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews, said the decisions made no sense on public safety or public health grounds. “It is like turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn. You can’t see what’s coming and you don’t know when it makes sense to turn them on again,” he said.Earlier this month, the government announced that its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) would no longer regularly meet to discuss coronavirus. Reicher, who sat on the Sage behavioural science subcommittee, said the decision to stop funding these surveillance studies was “far more significant than standing down Sage”.He said: “Those scientists are still working and can reconvene quickly. But how can they work – or know if they need to reconvene – if the data isn’t there?”The ending offree mass testingon 1 April could make the situation even worse. “Johnson’s insistence that ‘tests will be available for anybody to buy’ completely misses the point,” said Dr Kit Yates, a mathematical biologist at the University of Bath. “Many people in the UK will not be in the position to spend a significant portion of their budget on testing each week. Others will simply be put off by the cost.“The consequence will be that testing drops significantly, people become less aware when they are infectious, and consequently less able to take the ‘personal responsibility’ that the government has been highlighting so vociferously in the aftermath of their removal of other Covid mitigations.”According to the latestONS figures, the percentage of people estimated to have tested positive for coronavirus rose in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the week ending 5 March, while the percentage of infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant also increased across all countries.Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and many other European countries have also seen a sharp increase in daily confirmed cases since the start of March.Dr Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, US, said the uptick could mark the beginning of a sixth wave of Covid infections in Europe, driven by a combination of the BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron variants and the relaxation of restrictions in many countries.Topol said: “There are definitive signs of a new wave starting throughout many countries in Europe, some of which also are also showing increases in Covid hospitalisations. It is hard, at this point, to determine if the cause is reducing or eliminating restrictions, BA.2’s higher rate of transmission, or waning of immune protection from vaccines.“Right now is the last time that countries like the UK and US should be cutting funding or abandoning any surveillance and testing measures. As much as we all would like it to be, the pandemic is far from over.”",1,
BBC News,Special educational needs centre looking for home,"A project hoping to create a community centre for children and adults with special educational needs (SEN) is looking for its first home. The people behind SEN Den Somerset want to open a cafe and day centre in Taunton that will provide respite for families. The space would have a sensory room and offer play sessions, music workshops and other facilities including soft play. ""We want it to be a real community space,"" said the project's training director Ruth Irvine. Ms Irvine said the idea came to her when she realised how many families were desperate for respite. ""There's really nowhere for children to go where they can be themselves without having to comply with a certain way of behaving,"" she told BBC Radio Somerset. The project's operations director Paul Arvidson said the cafe will be ""open to everybody"" and will provide opportunities for people to ""get involved"" and ""learn how to do things in the cafe"". SEN Den Somerset is now looking for a base, applying for grants and crowdfunding to try to make the project a reality. ""In order to make a building accessible, it needs proper ramps,"" said Mr Arvidson. ""A Changing Places toilet isn't cheap,"" he added.

Jacobin,Jacobin,"US leaders are split between a hard right that would happily sacrifice millions of lives to let businesses keep operating and a liberal center that seems unable to merge the goals of stemming the pandemic and meeting the economic needs of Americans whose livelihoods have been disrupted by it. The truth is, fixing one means fixing the other. President-elect Joe Biden delivers a Thanksgiving address at the Queen Theatre on November 25, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. (Mark Makela / Getty Images) Our new issue, “Bye Bye Bidenism,” is out now.Subscribeto our print edition at a discounted rate today. For the past year, politics in the United States has been shuffled into a zero-sum game of either wrangling the coronavirus pandemic or keeping the economy healthy and strong. Almost as the virus began raging, various pundits and officials started weighing up exactly how much mass death they’d be willing to accept for the sake of continued profit. By November, voters had cleaved themselves into two camps based on these two seemingly separate ambitions, with each major party’s presidential candidate centering their pitch around one or the other. The truth is, this was a false choice, and it still is. In the real world, the economic responseisthe pandemic response, and vice versa. Even the most stalwart voices of unfettered capitalism have urged bold economic measures in the face of the ongoing pandemic. Early on, theFinancial Timeseditorial boardcalled for“radical reforms,” including “a more active role in the economy” for governments, redistribution in the form of “basic income and wealth taxes,” and the strengthening of labor rights and investment in public services. This advice has been echoed by a chorus of officials from no less than the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for decadeseffectively a global payday lendercontrolled by the neoliberal elite. Over the last two months, we’ve seen: the IMF’s managing directorinsistthat “lifelines for businesses and for workers are sustained” by the US government; its chief economistarguethat, because of the multiplier effect from public spending, “fiscal stimulus is not just economically sound policy but also the fiscally responsible thing to do”; and a coterie of officials from its fiscal affairs departmentplaceeconomic policies like cash transfers and unemployment benefits next to public health measures like testing and tracing in importance, urging governments to tax the rich and profitable, and funnel the proceeds into “health and social safety nets.” Prescriptions like these overlap with the advice from more left-leaning organizations like theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Developmentand theInternational Labor Organization(ILO). “Just as we need to redouble our efforts to beat the virus, so we need to act urgently and at scale to overcome its economic, social and employment impacts,” the ILO’s director-general said in September. We know from experience that this isn’t just theory. As economists across the board have pointed out, the $600 extra per week that Americans were getting in federal unemployment insurance for four months, to allow people to observe anti-pandemic stay-at-home orders while ensuring they didn’t tumble into poverty in the middle of an economic shutdown, wasthe only reasonthe US economy didn’t collapse. The money kept the consumer spending that undergirds the economy flowing at nearly pre-pandemic levels, as thisJuly studyfrom JPMorgan Chase showed. As everyone from the left-leaningEconomic Policy Instituteto thechief economist at Moody’s Analyticshasargued, these and other policies that put spending money into the pockets of poor and other working people would be a boon for the economy. It’s why evenForbesmagazine— which spent the Great Recessionmakingthe caseagainstunemployment insurance —championedextending the unusually generous unemployment program this time around. But there’s more than just an economic dimension to these policies. Anti-poverty programs like the extended unemployment insurance — by allowing people to afford proper nutrition, pay for health care and protective items, avoid taking risky jobs, escape unsanitary and crowded housing, and so much more — are also vital for containing the spread of the virus. This applies to so much more than just this one policy. Preventing mass evictions and housing the homeless isn’t just a moral imperative. It also helps prevent the spread of the pandemic, which, as the CDC hasstudiedandadvised, homeless communities areparticularly vulnerableto. A Medicare for All system would not only solve a long-running health and household income crisis, it would also remove akey roadblockto getting preventive treatment and prevent the countless deaths caused bydelaying care to avoid medical billsor fromfestering health problemsthat worsen coronavirus infection. You could make the same point about everything fromenvironmentaltohousingpolicy. Unfortunately, this basic insight seems unattainable to most of the people meant to be running the United States. The Right is, as per usual, way off the deep end, thanks to a mix of ideological zealotry and typically black-hearted ruthlessness. Having secured a massive corporate bailout in the first few rounds of pandemic relief bills, Republicans have, particularly after the election, dragged their feet on another stimulus bill,narrowing its sizeandcontinuingtooppose unemployment insurance, despite thepleas of economistsand even as economic conditionstake a nosedive. On the liberal side, meanwhile, incoming president Joe Biden seems to have learned nothing from his general electionunderperformance, continuing to silo the economic and health response just as he did during the campaign. Theseven-point plan“to beat COVID-19 and get our country back on track” that Biden released shortly before the electionfocuses exclusivelyon technocratic, logistical elements of containing the virus — upping testing and tracing, producing more protective equipment, vaccine distribution, creating various task forces and government agencies, and so on — and includes almost nothing about the economic issues that are critical to the scope of this crisis. At this stage, it’snot even clearif athus-far noncommittalBiden is going to extend and strengthen Donald Trump’s eviction moratorium, a repeat of the election, when Trumpissued the ordera month after Biden failed to include it in hisemergency housing package. None of that may matter now; other thanasking Democratsto vote for the truncated stimulus bill now on offer, Biden seems to have largelytaken a back seatin the current negotiations. But it will soon enough. Biden has promised more relief to come once he’s inaugurated, and it’s still more than likely that even once vaccines start being rolled out, the pandemic will continue to be a serious concern long into his presidency. Beyond that, who knows how long it will be before thenext pandemic strikes. Thus far, Biden’s public messaging suggests he’ll remain reluctant or unable to fuse the economic and public health elements of the current crisis to sell an ambitious response to the public,somethingeven his centrist running matewas able to dobefore she tethered herself to his political fortunes. And the alternative? A Republican Party that is asreluctant to lift a fingerto help its own people as it is disdainful of science andsimplecommon sense. But don’t let the shortsightedness of the country’s ossified major parties fool you: as with climate change, the choice isn’t between dealing with a slow-burning crisis and creating a strong, just economy. To do one properly is to do the other. The task is forcing the kind of political change that ensures those at the top understand that.

Breitbart,Associated Press: We ‘Had No Knowledge of Oct. 7 Attacks Before They Happened’,"The Associated Press told Breitbart News on Wednesday that it had no foreknowledge of the October 7 terror attack by the Palestinian terror group Hamas, despite evidence that its photographers seemed to capture terrorists in action in real time. The pro-Israel media watchdog group HonestReporting.com published an analysis on Wednesday in which it raised ethical questions about the conduct of AP and Reuters photographers from Gaza, who appeared to accompany the Hamas invasion. HonestReporting.comsaid: What were they doing there so early on what would ordinarily have been a quiet Saturday morning? Was it coordinated with Hamas? Did the respectable wire services, which published their photos, approve of their presence inside enemy territory, together with the terrorist infiltrators? Did the photojournalists who freelance for other media, like CNN and The New York Times, notify these outlets? Judging from the pictures of lynching, kidnapping and storming of an Israeli kibbutz, it seems like the border has been breached not only physically, but also journalistically. HonestReporting cited tweets of one photographer, Hassan Eslaiah, who had posed in front of a disabled Israeli tank without a helmet or flak jacket, as if he knew he would be safe from Hamas terrorists who were killing every civilian in sight. After the article was published, HonestReporting updated its article to note that Eslaiah had once posed for a selfie with Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza-based leader of Hamas. The Associated Press responded to a Breitbart News media query with the following statement: The Associated Press had no knowledge of the Oct. 7 attacks before they happened. The role of the AP is to gather information on breaking news events around the world, wherever they happen, even when those events are horrific and cause mass casualties. AP uses images taken by freelancers around the world, including in Gaza. Reuters had not responded by the time of this article’s publication. News agencies have often faced ethical problems in covering terrorist groups at war with Israel. Hamas, a terrorist group, does not permit dissent and will not allow reporters or photographers into Gaza who do not reflect the group’s message. At times, photographers have doctored images to suit the propaganda needs of terror groups. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Reuters was forced tofirea photographer after he was caught digitally altering an image of an Israeli airstrike. Joel B.

The Guardian,Trevor Noah: 'Nobody expected that Trump’s lawyers would be so terrible',"Late-night hosts react to thesecond day of Donald Trump’s impeachment trialfor inciting insurrection, in which House managers played disturbing footage from the 6 January attack on the Capitol.Trevor NoahWith all the footage from theCapitol siegeand social media posts by the rioters, House impeachment managers have “basically a slam-dunk case”, said Trevor Noah on Wednesday’s Daily Show. “This would be like having a murder suspect who left his DNA at the scene, dropped a bloody glove, and fled the scene in a Ford Bronco,” he added, referencing the OJ Simpson case. “There would beno wayyou couldn’t convict that guy!”The impeachment trial continues, and nobody is more upset about Trump’s s**ty lawyers than the man who was never gonna pay them anyway.pic.twitter.com/LqQJm7h1g2— The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow)February 11, 2021On Wednesday, House impeachment managersdisplayed “harrowing” videoof the violent attack on the Capitol and its police. “We all expected the Democrats to present a competent, compelling case,” Noah said of the emotional footage. “But what nobody expected was that Trump’s lawyers would be so terrible.”Trump’s two defense lawyers, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, rambled through several tangents and never offered a cogent defense for the ex-president. “It was going so badly for the Republicans, I thought Ted Cruz was going to start another insurrection just to change the subject,” Noah joked.Related:Jimmy Kimmel on GOP senators: 'The sad truth is they’re a bunch of cowards'But “luckily for these lawyers, we all know, and they know, that no matter how bad their defense is, they’re still gonna win this trial”, Noah added, which “makes a mockery of the entire idea of accountability”.Stephen ColbertThe second impeachment trial of Donald Trump was always going to be rough, but “turns out it’s even worse than we thought”, said Stephen Colbert following day two. “And I gotta tell you: I came into this with my ‘it’s pretty bad’ septic tank already brimming over.”The Late Show host replayed a horrifying clip of the Capitol siege in which officerEugene Goodman directedthe Utah senator Mitt Romney, one of the few Republicans openly critical of Trump, away from the oncoming mob. “Keep in mind, those maniacs would’ve loved to have gotten their hands on Mitt Romney, who voted to impeach the former president the last time that he deserved it,” Colbert said.Yet “despite the powerful evidence supplied by the House managers and objective reality, many GOP senators seemed to bebarely paying attention”, instead reading books or briefing papers on other topics. “Yes, other more interesting topics,” Colbert deadpanned, “like ‘how does history tend to remember cowardly fascists and enabling worthless pieces of garbage?’”Seth MeyersGiven the amount of evidence amassed by House impeachment managers, “you think [Trump’s] lawyers would be a little more prepared”, said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “Instead, Castor meandered aimlessly like he was auditioning to be on one of those sleep apps.”Among Castor’s rambling lines: “There isn’t a member in this room who has not used the term ‘I represent the great state of fill-in-the-blank.’ Why? Because they’re all great? Yeah. But you think yours is greater than others because these are your people.”“I left a voicemail on ecstasy in 1997 that made more sense than this,” Meyers zinged. “What are you talking about? The House managers just laid out a devastating case against the president with harrowing video footage and you sound like you’re vamping at the end of social studies class.”Castor’s teammate David Schoen, meanwhile, went with what Meyers called the “heinous asshole” route, with hyperbole such as: “This trial will tear this country apart, perhaps like we have only seen once before in our history.”“I’m sorry, are you threatening a second civil war?” Meyers fumed. “You know that’s basically what Trump got impeached for, right? That’s like if OJ’s lawyers had said, ‘You better acquit him, or I will stab every one of you.’”Jimmy Kimmel“I have no idea how you could watch that and vote for anything other than guilty as charged,” said Jimmy Kimmel of the riot footage played by House impeachment managers. “Trump should’ve been removed from office that day.”Nevertheless, conviction appears to be a remote possibility, as Republican senators are loth to anger Trump’s base. The defense’s argument is “basically telling Republican senators ‘Nice jobs you’ve got there, would be a shame if something were to happen to them!’” Kimmel said.Trump, meanwhile,was reportedto not be happy with his lawyers’ performance, which left him screaming at his TV. “They say the last time he was this mad was when he found out there was a Donald Trump Jr,” Kimmel joked.Samantha BeeAnd on Full Frontal, Samantha Bee skirted the impeachment trial in a segment on the movement to raise the federal minimum wage to $15. “The pandemic has put a renewed focus on a working class that now has to risk getting sick on the job while receiving little to no support,” she explained. The US minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009 – “it’s insane that America updates its Spidermen more frequently than the minimum wage,” Bee joked.Raising the minimum wage would help 10.5 million families who rely on safety net programs such as Medicaid, Chip or Snap, Bee explained. “Republicans love to bash these programs and claim too many people are using them, but fewer people would need assistance if their employers just paid them a living wage. It’s not fucking rocket science.”Joe Biden’s plan would raise the minimum wage gradually to $15 by 2025. “Think of it as minimum wage foreplay,” said Bee. “It will take awhile to build but when it gets there, it’s fine.“Regardless of what Republicans say, paying Americans fairly doesn’t soften the economy,” she later concluded. “It strengthens it, it makes it bigger – like foreplay!”",1,
Fox News,The conservative Andrew Yang? GOP strategists react to 'anti-woke' crusader Vivek Ramaswamy's White House run,"Entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy makes his case for the GOP presidential nomination on 'Fox & Friends.' Vivek Ramaswamy, one day after announcing a 2024 presidential run, says his White House bid ""isn’t just a political campaign, but a cultural movement."" The health care and tech sector entrepreneur, conservative commentator and author and culture wars crusader declared his candidacy for president in a live interview on Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Tuesday and quickly hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire, which holds the second contest in theRepublican presidential nominating calendar. Ramaswamy, the 37-year-old author of ""Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,"" says his vision isabout restoring the ""national identity in America."" While they are polar opposites when it comes to policy, some political pundits are comparing Ramaswamy to Andrew Yang, whose unconventional ideas and outsider campaign caught on with many voters four years ago. FIRST ON FOX: CULTURE WARS CRUSADER VIVEK RAMASWAMY LAUNCHES 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy campaigns at Potter's Bakery in Rochester, N.H., Feb. 22, 2023.(Vivek Ramaswamy campaign ) Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who achieved business world success as an entrepreneur, saw his one-time long shot bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination soar before ultimately sputtering out. ""The way I see Vivek is very similar to what we saw from Andrew Yang in 2020, where he expands the conversation, he looks at the issues in a different way and provides an outsider’s type of perspective and brings new ideas – which is really exciting – into the process,"" ""New Hampshire Today"" radio host Chris Ryan told Fox News. ""As a result of that, I think he’s going to resonate with a significant portion of the base."" WHAT TIM SCOTT TOLD FOX NEWS AS HE ARRIVED IN IOWA, SPARKING MORE 2024 BUZZ The son of Indian immigrants, Ramaswamy,like Yang,has been very successful in the private sector. And now he’s trying to follow in Yang’s footsteps as he enters a GOP presidential primary field that already includes former President Trump and former South Carolina Governor and former Ambassador Nikki Haley, who’s also a first-generation Indian American. ""It’s great to see Vivek coming in and bringing a positive, forward-looking message. I think that’s going to be critical to being successful in 2024,""New Hampshire-based conservative strategist and activist Greg Moore told Fox News. Andrew Yang(Fox News Digital) Moore, the longtime state director for the influential conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, noted that Ramaswamy has ""a very interesting story – a first generation American. Although ideologically very different, in many ways his background is very similar to Andrew Yang, who ran for president in 2020 on the Democratic side."" He emphasized the ""tremendous optimist that typically comes along with first-generation Americans. People who still have the family who can tell them what they came from and why they came to America. And that’s why first-generation Americans tend to be some of the optimistic people you will find, and Vivek definitely has that space."" Despite comparisons to Yang, Ramaswamy would like to emulate another one-time presidential long shot who ended up in the White House — former President Trump. Like Ramaswamy,Trump entered the 2016 cyclewith low expectations but plenty of entrepreneurial spirit and unconventional ideas. In his Fox News’ interview on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Ramaswamy referred to Trump as a ""friend"" and said he respected what the former president was able to accomplish during the 2016 election, which inspired his own presidential ambitions. But Ramaswamy emphasized that the nation cannot be ""looking in the rearview mirror,"" a likely reference to Trump’s repeated attempts to litigate his 2020 election loss to President Biden. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""He spoke to problems as an outsider, not as an insider politician … that spotted problems that no other politician was talking about or even able to talk about and addressed some of those issues. But the question is, where do we go from here,"" Ramaswamy said. ""And I do think that he got the country to a certain point, but ‘Make America Great Again,’ ‘MAGA,’ ‘America First,’ these are big ideas. These are ideas that are so big that none of us — not me, not Ron DeSantis, not Donald Trump — has a monopoly on those ideas. These ideas are bigger than any individual. … In order to put America first, you have to first rediscover what America is.""",0,
Fox News,CDC guidance says some essential workers exposed to coronavirus can return to work,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.Sign up here. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced newcoronavirusguidance Wednesday saying some essential workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms can return to work. Each worker would need to take his or her temperature twice a day for signs of a fever and wear a face mask at work and out in public to prevent the spread of the virus,Dr. Robert Redfield,the director of the CDC, said at Wednesday's White House coronavirus briefing. DR. FAUCI: 'WE'RE STARTING TO SEE GLIMMERS OF HOPE ' BUT DISTANCING STRATEGIES MUST BE 'INTENSIFIED' Redfield said the guidance was an effort to ""really begin to get these critical workers back into the workforce so that we won't have worker shortage in these critical industries,"" including first responders, health-care workers, food supply workers and more. The CDC also was encouraging employers to take their employees' temperatures at the beginning of the workday and send home any workers who showed symptoms. In addition, officials said buildings should increase their air exchange and increase the frequency of how they clean common rooms and areas. Employees still have been discouraged from congregating in break rooms, lunchrooms or any large gathering spaces, Redfield said. The new considerations by the CDC signaled the slightest hope for a return to normalcy in the U.S. even as the death toll reached 13,929 and the country continues to grapple with 404,352 cases of the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci,director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Wednesday that if the social distancing strategies implemented through the end of April are successful in slowing the curve and spread of coronavirus, the government could start to peel back some of the restrictions in the weeks to come. “If, in fact, we are successful, it makes sense to at least plan what a re-entry into normality would look like,” Fauci told Fox News. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to do it right now, but it means we need to be prepared to ease into that.” Even though “we’re starting to see some glimmers of hope,” the United States needs to “keep pushing on the mitigation strategies,” Fauci said, reiterating that tactics such as social distancing need to continue because “there is no doubt that that’s having a positive impact on the dynamics of the outbreak.” Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said that although the death toll is staggering in the U.S. -- and third to only Italy and Spain with the highest number of deceased -- ""the deaths generally lag by a couple of weeks behind what's fueling the outbreak, namely the number of new cases and the number of hospitalizations.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Still, health officials, including Fauci, remain skeptical of reopening the country's economy too soon, as recent studies suggest that some people who are infected with the virus do not show any symptoms, while others who have developed symptoms of COVID-19 and recovered may remain contagious. Fauci told reporters during a press briefing Sunday that between 25 and 50 percent of infected Americans are not exhibiting symptoms of the virus. “That is an estimate. I don’t have any scientific data yet to say that,” he added. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0,

AP News,"After 15 months of war, Hamas still rules over what remains of Gaza","As a ceasefire brought calm to Gaza’s ruined cities, Hamas was quick to emerge from hiding. The militant group has not only survived15 months of war with Israel— among the deadliest and most destructive in recent memory — but it remains firmly in control of the coastal territory that now resembles an apocalyptic wasteland. With a surge of humanitarian aid promised as part of the ceasefire deal, the Hamas-run government said Monday that it will coordinate distribution to the desperate people of Gaza.

(AP Photo/Abed Hajjar)  For all the military might Israel deployed in Gaza, it failed to remove Hamas from power, one of its central war aims. That could make a return to fighting more likely, but the results might be the same. There was an element of theater inSunday’s handover of three Israeli hostagesto the Red Cross, when dozens of masked Hamas fighters wearing green headbands and military fatigues paraded in front of cameras and held back a crowd of hundreds who surrounded the vehicles. The scenes elsewhere in Gaza were even more remarkable: Thousands of Hamas-run police in uniform re-emerged, making their presence known even in the most heavily destroyed areas.

(AP Photo/Leo Correa)  “The police have been here the whole time, but they were not wearing their uniforms” to avoid being targeted by Israel, said Mohammed Abed, a father of three who returned to his home in Gaza City more than seven months after fleeing the area.  “They were among the displaced people in the tents. That’s why there were no thefts,” he said. Other residents said the police had maintained offices in hospitals and other locations throughout the war, where people could report crimes. Israel has repeatedly blamed Hamas for the heavy civilian death toll and damage to infrastructure because the group’s fighters and security forces embed themselves in residential neighborhoods, schools and hospitals.

(AP Photo/Abed Hajjar)  Opinion polls consistently show that only a minority of Palestinians support Hamas. But the Islamic militant group —which does not accept Israel’s existence— is deeply rooted in Palestinian society, with an armed wing, a political party, media and charities that date back to its founding in the late 1980s. For decades, Hamas functioned as a well-organized insurgency, able to launch hit-and-run attacks on Israeli forces and suicide bombings in Israel itself.Many of its top leaders have been killed— and quickly replaced. It won a landslide victory in 2006 parliamentary elections, and the following year it seized Gaza from the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in a week of street battles. Hamas then established a fully-fledged government, with ministries, police and a civilian bureaucracy. Its security forces quickly brought Gaza’s powerful families into line and crushed rival armed groups. They also silenced dissent andviolently dispersed occasional protests. Hamas remained in power throughfour previous wars with Israel. With help from Iran it steadily enhanced its capabilities, extended the range of its rockets and built deeper and longer tunnels to hide from Israeli airstrikes. By Oct. 7, 2023, it had an army of tens of thousands in organized battalions. In the surprise incursion that triggered the war, its fighters attacked southern Israel by air, land and sea, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas-led militants abducted 250 others. In response, Israel launched an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and has reduced entire neighborhoodsto fields of rubble. Some 90% of Gaza’s population has been displaced, often multiple times. Nearly every day of the war, the Israeli military announced that it had killed dozens of fighters, or taken out a midlevel commander, or dismantled a tunnel complex or obliterated a weapons factory. Israeli forces killedHamas’ top leader, Yahya Sinwar, and most of his lieutenants. But the exiled leadership is mostly intact and Mohammed Sinwar, his brother, has reportedly assumed a bigger role in Gaza.

(AP Photo/Abed Hajjar)  The military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters — roughly half of Hamas’ estimated prewar ranks — though it has not provided evidence. What Israel said were carefully targeted strikes frequently killed women and children and in some caseswiped out entire extended families. The military blamed civilian casualties on Hamas. But survivors of the bombardment, crammed into tents after their homes were flattened, were a pool of potential recruits. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a prepared speech that Hamas had recruited nearly as many fighters as it lost during the war. Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert on Palestinian affairs and former military intelligence officer, said Hamas no longer has the ability to launch an Oct. 7-style attack but has returned to its insurgent roots, using creative tactics like harvesting unexploded Israeli ordnance for homemade bombs. “Hamas is a chameleon. It changed its colors according to the circumstances,” he said. “The war is ending with a strong perception of success for Hamas,” he added. “The enlistment capabilities will be crazy. They won’t be able to handle it.” Palestinian critics of Hamas have long said there is no military solution to the Mideast conflict, which predates the birth of the militant group by several decades. They argue that Palestinians would be more likely to break with Hamasif they had an alternative pathto ending Israel’s decades-long occupation,which has further entrenched itselfduring the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has ensured they do not. He has rebuffed proposals from the United States and friendly Arab countries for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern both Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank ahead of eventual statehood. Instead, he has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories. Avi Issacharoff, a veteran Israeli journalist — and co-creator of the Netflix hit “Fauda” — said Netanyahu’s refusal to plan for the day after was the “biggest debacle of this war.” “Israel is waking up from a nightmare into the very same nightmare,” he wrote in Israel’s Yediot Ahronot newspaper. “Hamas is going to remain in power and will continue to build more tunnels and recruit more men, without the emergence of any local alternative.” Netanyahu has threatened to resume the war after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire if Israel’s goals are not met, while Hamas has said it will not release dozens of remaining captives without a lasting truce and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. There’s no reason to think another military campaign would bring about a different result. In early October, Israeli forces sealed off the northern towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya, barring nearly all humanitarian aid, forcing thousands to flee and destroying nearly every structure in their path, including schools and shelters, according to witnesses who fled. The army had carried out major operations in all three places previously, only to see militants regroup. At least 15 Israeli soldiers have died in northern Gaza this month alone. When residents returned to Jabaliya on Sunday, they found a sprawling scene of devastation with only a few tilted shells of buildings in a sea of gray rubble. Dozens of Hamas police kept watch over their return. Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writer Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel contributed.

The Guardian,Parents back call by UK teacher to help end 'white supremacy',"A primary school headteacher says he has been “overwhelmed by support” after calling on parents to help tackle structural racism.Robbie McGrath, headteacher at Malin Bridge primary school in Hillsborough, Sheffield, wrote to parents last week after thedeath of George Floyd in the US on 25 May.“It is too easy to look at America and dismiss the issues because our police officers do not carry guns,” McGrath wrote. “The root cause is the same both in the USA and UK. Our society is built upon white supremacy.”McGrath said while the term conjured images of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis, “white supremacy is much subtler than this. In many instances it is the unidentified bias that sits within the majority of us that white people are superior to people of colour.”He went on to urge parents to have “an honest and open conversation” with their children, so that they could “recognise the existence of white privilege”.He told the Guardian he had received scores of emails from parents since.“Our private WhatsApp parents’ groups have been filled with positive messages. People have shown the letter to their bosses, and to their staff.”McGrath said he had decided to write the letter after sending an email to staff mentioning the Black Lives Matter movement and realising how few of them had heard of George Floyd. “It occurred to me that a lot of white people would be confused by what was happening in America, and the silent complicity was getting to me. I’d already done the reading and so I just drafted it. I should probably have checked with the governors, but I knew that everything I was writing was true.”More than 600 pupils attend the outstanding-rated school. Helen Berry, whose son is in year 2, shared the letter on Facebook. She said: “I am very impressed by Mr McGrath. It’s how he’s put his words into actions. He is well respected in our community and people will listen. It inspired me to learn more and think more about my role, how we can all step up in some way.”The impact of the letter has been felt outside the school gates, with a local pub adopting an anti-racist stance.“I’m a 37-year-old white man who plays golf, and is a season-ticket holder for Sheffield United,” said McGrath.“Most of my mates are of a similar background. When I sent them the letter, they said it was a hard read, and they had a tough period of reflection. But they sent it on to friends and work colleagues. One of my best friends, who is white, and had the least privileged upbringing of anyone I know, runs a pub nearby. He has sent out the letter on his Twitter feed and to his staff. He says he wants his pub to be anti-racist.”He added: “It is accepted that there is institutional bias, across the world. If we are going to move forward, it is white people who are going to have to take the leading role because they are the ones who hold the power. There is no quick fix.“Every day tiny white privileges, like the shampoo bottles in hotels – they’re not for black hair – build up, and create this idea of white skin as the norm.“It is about recognising that some inequalities have been around for such a long time, that some groups benefit from them.”",1,
AP News,"Sho-time in Tokyo: Ohtani, Dodgers prepare to open MLB season vs. Cubs on Tuesday","TOKYO (AP) — TheMajor League Baseball seasonkicks off Tuesday night at the Tokyo Dome when Shohei Ohtani and the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers face the Chicago Cubs. It’s the first of a two-game series andfeatures five Japanese players. Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and rookie Roki Sasaki pitch for the Dodgers while the Cubs have outfielder Seiya Suzuki and left-handed pitcher Shota Imanaga. The two MLB teams have been in Tokyo for several days, playing exhibition games against two Japanese teams — theHanshin Tigersand Yomiuri Giants. All four exhibition games had a capacity crowd of roughly 42,000. A similar atmosphere is expected for the two MLB games. “Everybody’s very aware of the series, that’s evident for sure, more than I feel like it would be America,” Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. “More people are talking about it, absolutely. That’s a great feeling. The players love big events, that’s why we do this, that’s why we love to do it.” Here are five things to know heading into the MLB opener:  The first game will feature the first all-Japanese pitching matchup on opening day in MLB history. Yamamoto will take the mound for the Dodgers against Imanaga of the Cubs. Yamamoto is entering his second seasonwith Los Angeles. He was 7-2 with a 3.00 ERA last season and was an important part of the team’s World Series championship, witha brilliant performance in a Game 2 winover the Yankees. Imanaga was an All-Star last year in his first season with the Cubs. The lefty finished with a 15-3 record and a 2.91 ERA in 2024. The Dodgers will start Sasaki in the second game on Wednesday night. Third baseman Matt Shaw is expected to make his big league debut for the Cubs on Tuesday.Shaw is one of the team’s top prospectsand did enough this spring to earn the starting nod. Shaw was drafted with the No. 13 overall pick in 2020 after playing college baseball at Maryland. He hit .284 with 21 homers and 71 RBIs last season, splitting time between Double-A and Triple-A. Other young Cubs include third-year outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, who hopes to take a big step forward after an encouraging second half of 2024. Rookie second baseman Gage Workman could also make his MLB debut in Tokyo. Dodgers shortstop Mookie Bettswill not play in either gameagainst the Chicago Cubs because of an illness that’s lingered for the past week. Manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Betts is starting to feel better but has lost nearly 15 pounds and is still trying to get rehydrated and gain strength. Roberts added that the eight-time All-Star might fly back to the United States before the team in an effort to rest and prepare for the domestic opener on March 27. Miguel Rojas will start at shortstop in Betts’ place. Set your alarm if you’re planning to view the two Tokyo games in the United States. Both games being at 7:10 p.m. in Tokyo, which means it’ll be a 6:10 a.m. wake up call in the Eastern time zone. Many Cubs and Dodgers fans will really need some coffee. Start time in Chicago is 5:10 a.m. while it’s 3:10 a.m. in Los Angeles. The game will air nationally on Fox. This marks the 25th anniversary of the first MLB regular season games played in Japan. The New York Mets and Cubs played a two-game set at the Tokyo Dome in 2000. Since that series, MLB returned in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2019. The 2019 series featured the Oakland A’s and Seattle Mariners, who celebrated the final two games of Ichiro Suzuki’s career in his home country. Suzuki will be inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer. It’s the 10th time that MLB has played regular season games in a spot outside the 50 states. The locations include Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Australia and last year’s series in South Korea. AP MLB:https://apnews.com/MLB",3,
BBC News,Trump election: Michigan supreme court rejects ballot disqualification bid,"Michigan's Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal by voters in the US state to disqualify Donald Trump from next year's presidential primary. They sought to invoke a clause in the US Constitution, barring anyone who has engaged in insurrection, over Mr Trump's role in the 2021 Capitol riots. The decision comes days after Colorado became the first state to rule that Mr Trump was not an eligible candidate. Michigan is considered a battleground state in the 2024 general election. Traditionally voting Democrat, Michigan narrowly supported Mr Trump, a Republican, in his successful 2016 presidential campaign. But the state reverted to the Democrats when Joe Biden carried it by a margin of nearly 3% in 2020. Unlike in Colorado, the Michigan bid failed early on in the process, and the appeal to the state's supreme court was seen as having little chance of success. Mr Trump praised the decision on Truth Social on Wednesday, calling it a ""pathetic gambit to rig the Election"". The ruling means that his name will appear on the ballot for the Republican primary, set to be held on 27 February. Pro-democracy advocacy group Free Speech for People filed the lawsuit in September, and the group said in a statement that the ruling was a narrow and technical one that applied only to the state's Republican primary. ""However, the Michigan Supreme Court did not rule out that the question of Donald Trump's disqualification for engaging in insurrection against the US Constitution may be resolved at a later stage,"" said Ron Fein, Free Speech For People's legal director. Lower courts in Michigan rejected the case on procedural grounds and did not examine the question of whether the Capitol riot 6 January 2021 qualified as an insurrection under the law and whether Mr Trump played a part in it. Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Welch explained that Michigan's laws were different from Colorado's. The appellants ""have identified no analogous provision in the Michigan Election Law that requires someone seeking the office of President of the United States to attest to their legal qualification to hold the office"", she wrote. What is the 14th Amendment? Trump's legal defeat may turn into political gold Colorado's 4-3 supreme court decision last week, which refers only to the state's Republican primary on 5 March, does not stop Mr Trump from running in other states. In the Colorado case, a lower court judge ruled that Mr Trump fell afoul of Section 3 of the US Constitution's 14th Amendment which bars officials ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" from holding federal office. It was the first instance of the Constitution being used to disqualify a presidential candidate. The amendment was ratified after the American Civil War to block Confederate secessionists from returning to power after southern states re-joined the Union. But legal experts say the ruling will have a tough time standing up when, as expected,it reaches the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court. Jocelyn Benson, Michigan's secretary of state - a position that among other things oversees elections - said the legal issues raised by the 14th Amendment were not clear cut. Ms Benson, a Democrat, also said she believed the questions should ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court. ""I continue to hope they do this sooner rather than later to ensure that we can move forward into 2024's election season focused on ensuring all voters are fully informed and universally engaged in deciding the issues at stake,"" she said. The Colorado decision has been put on hold pending an appeal deadline in January. Similar attempts to kick Mr Trump off the ballot in New Hampshire and Minnesota have failed. Also on Wednesday, Mr Trump's lawyers urged Maine's secretary of state to recuse herself from a 14th Amendment bid to kick Mr Trump off the ballot in that state. In Maine, ballot challenges are heard by the secretary of state at first instance, not the courts. Mr Trump's campaign have claimed that Shenna Bellows, a progressive Democrat, is biased against him. Citing tweets she sent in the aftermath of the 2021 Capitol riot, they claimed she had ""already passed judgment on the Challengers' core assertions"". Ms Bellows is expected to issue her ruling in the coming days.",2,
Fox News,"Teaching race doesn't mean teaching critical race theory, activists say","Rocky Mountain Black Conservatives Executive Director Derrick Wilburn elaborates on his viral school board speech slamming critical race theory Critical race theoryshould play no part in teaching Black history, American history or ethnic studies in schools, according to a diverse group of experts and activists. In a recentNBC Newsreport, Black students in New Orleans expressed concern that CRT bans may lead to an erasing of America's true history. That didn't sit well withShawntel Cooper, a Virginia mom with two biracial students attending Loudoun County schools who has been an outspoken opponent of critical race theory. ""We never said don’t teach history – we are fighting to ban CRT,"" she said. She brought up an August incident in which a preschool class reportedly hung up a poster with students' portraits divided on a table by skin color. ""My ancestors did not fight for segregation to be played out again or to indoctrinate little children to alter their natural growth to love without seeing color,"" she said. Critical race theory is a school of thought that places race and racism at the center of public life and American institutions. Proponents say it addresses systemic racism; critics say it’s a form of racism itself. For months, progressive pundits dismissed critical race theory as an esoteric topic for advanced graduate courses, downplaying its presence in K-12 education – even as parents around the country grilled their school boards over CRT-inspired content whenever it surfaced on district materials. Then, in July, the nation’s largest teachers union endorsed teaching CRT as ""reasonable and appropriate"" for children. Nearly half of the 50 United States have enacted bans on critical race theory in public schools, and some districts have taken similar measures on their own. And the Senate approved a ban on federal funding for CRT in schools last month. Nicole Neily, the founder and president of Parents Defending Education, told Fox News Friday that critical race theory aims to ""reduce people to factors outside of their control"" and strip away their individual identity to define them by their race – nothing to do with teaching history. ""Claims that bans on critical race theory prohibit ‘teaching about racism in schools’ are factually inaccurate - and that's not, in fact, what parents or legislators oppose at all,"" she said. ""People object to the rampant discrimination taking place in America's schools that treat children differently on the basis of immutable characteristics such as race and gender – which is something that all Americans should oppose, because to do so is both immoral and unconstitutional."" SENATE PASSES COTTON'S AMENDMENT PREVENTING FEDERAL FUNDS FROM PROMOTING CRT IN SCHOOL Bob Woodson Sr., a civil rights activist and founder of the Woodson Center, a D.C.-based nonprofit that works to transform troubled neighborhoods, lives and schools, said critical race theory, by painting Black Americans as victims without agency, is actually the opposite of Black history. His1776 Unitesproject has aimed to tackle critical race theory in the controversial New York Times 1619 Project directly. ""It’s also having a detrimental effect on the Black community,"" he said. ""It's insulting for progressive Whites to convey the notion that somehow Black Americans have no ability to be agents of their own uplifting, and therefore, until and unless White America can make certain concessions and does something to help that Black America is going to be forever disadvantaged."" In California’sPaso Robles Joint Unified School District, the school board voted last month to ban critical race theory but ensure students received an adequate, accurate dose of ethnic studies. VIRGINIA MOM WHO SURVIVED MAOIST CHINA EVISCERATES SCHOOL BOARD'S CRITICAL RACE THEORY PUSH ""Ethnic studies can be taught as a history course: You look at the trials and tribulations of various ethnic groups that have come to the United States and how they've merged into the American melting pot,"" Paso Robles school board President Chris Arend told Fox News Friday. ""Or you can take critical race theory, which drives a wedge between races and is a basically a Marxist-based ideology."" The new ethnic studies curriculum will apply critical thinking in the classroom, he said, not critical race theory, which ""dumbs people down."" ""Instead of looking at the complexity of a society made up of millions of individuals, it doubles down to oppressor and oppressed – Black and White, and it ignores individuality,"" said Arend, a former lawyer who has studied critical race theory extensively and written criticisms of its tenets and the idea of systemic racism. 1776 UNITES MEMBER BLASTS CRITICAL RACE THEORY BUT WARNS ABOUT 1619 PROJECT TOO Race can certainly be taught in context and with complexity without bringing the left-wing critical race theory into the classroom, according to both Woodson and Arend. ""The good, the bad and the ugly ought to be told,"" Woodson said. ""But the left only wants to talk about the ugly."" The education gap closed in the American south between 1920 and 1940, he said, because of community fundraising efforts and matching grants from Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald, the former CEO of Sears. He mentioned Black Wall Streets in cities across the country and Black-owned businesses, banks, insurance companies, hotels and even an interstate railroad, founded to counter segregation. ""This rich history of self-achievement, of accomplishment, of resistance to slavery through acts of self-determination, that’s American history,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Slavery and racism are a ""birth defect,"" he added – but one the United States has spent much of its history striving to cure. ""America is a nation of redemption,"" he said. ""It’s like somebody only telling the story of the crucifixion and leaving out the resurrection…looking at life through the lens of Good Friday and not Easter Sunday. The left wants to define America as being all Good Friday.""",0,
The Guardian,Russia claims Ukraine shelling Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – as it happened,"7.00pmGMTClosing summaryIt’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said.Video footage posted on social mediashowed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border.The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory.For Kyivthe strike represented an unprecedented operationto disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter.Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin.The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR),Denis Pushilin,said Ukrainian shellinghad killed a deputyin the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council,Maria Pirogova.Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap.According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff,said.Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts.Ina statement,the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts.Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday.The strikesdamaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities.Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe.Shoigusaid Russian forces were taking “all measures”to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv.Russia’s defence ministryhas saidit has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula.Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed withcomments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”.He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”.A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil.Mikhailo Podolyaktold the Guardianthat Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday.A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk.Suedi Murekezi, 35,told the Guardianhe had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers.Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds.EarlierViktor Orbán’s government wasaccused of “holding hostage” fundsfor Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungaryconfirmed on Tuesdaythat it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen asan attempt to gain leverage in separate disputesover Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds.Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”.Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had beentargeted with packagessoaked in liquid with a distinctive smelland containing animals’ eyes.The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions.Byswitching off their tracker systemson the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to

occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia.6.16pmGMTThe European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine.Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week.If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector.The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals.5.53pmGMTUkrainian hospitals to temporarily suspend

forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine.The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula.It was also forced to apologise to viewers

reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security.TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content.Its founder,Natalya Sindeeva,posted a video this

Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff,said.The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments.Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes andknocked out powerin some areas.Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday.The strikesdamaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities.Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe.Shoigusaid Russian forces were taking “all measures”to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv.Russia’s defence ministryhas saidit has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula.Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed withcomments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”.He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”.A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil.Mikhailo Podolyaktold the Guardianthat Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday.A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk.Suedi Murekezi, 35,told the Guardianhe had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers.Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds.EarlierViktor Orbán’s government wasaccused of “holding hostage” fundsfor Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungaryconfirmed on Tuesdaythat it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine.

The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet.“Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.”Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests.“So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said.Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday.He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off.Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations.“It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said.Updatedat 2.56pm GMT1.57pmGMTRussia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials.My colleagueDan Sabbaghquotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia.Western officials - Russia *ran out* of Iranian drones 2-3 weeks ago and is now ""anticipating a resupply"".Still no sign of Iran supplying missiles to Russia; military relationship between the two countries remains under negotiation between them— Dan Sabbagh (@dansabbagh)December 6, 2022Strikes on Russian airbases of last 30 hours will complicate future bombing missions against Ukraine but effect is likely to be primarily psychological.

Breitbart,Exclusive – Watch: State Republican Group Touts Red State Economic Recovery Despite Biden Failures,"In an ad first shared with Breitbart News, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) released a video highlighting the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s (BLS) Maydatashowing states with Republican-led legislatures are leading the economic recovery despite President’s Joe Biden failures. The RSLC’s video talked about the Republican states leaving their Democrat counterparts — who have mimicked Biden’s “disastrous” economic policies — when it comes to lowering their unemployment rates. BLS’s May state economic data shows that eight of ten states with the lowest unemployment rates have Republican-led legislatures. The are also 18 state with Republican-led legislatures that hit record low unemployment rates in 2022. At the same time, the data showed that seven out of ten states with the highest unemployment rates have Democrat-led legislatures. “State Republicans’ rejection of President Biden’s reckless tax-and-spend agenda shielded their constituents from the worst of Bidenflation, and the conservative policies they implemented have Republican-led states better positioned to weather the national recession Biden is thrusting on the American people,” RSLC Communications Director Andrew Romeo told Breitbart News. Romeo added, “It is a shame that state Democrats are too wedded to their socialist agenda to reverse course and begin following Republicans’ lead by lowering costs and expanding economic opportunity.” Interestingly enough, the ten states with the highestincreasein personal income from 2020 to 2021 are led by Republicans. Also, the 15 states with thecheapest gas priceshappen to be led by Republicans. Additionally, since Biden has taken office, 19 Republican-led states have cut taxes, as more state legislatures across the country have similar legislation on the way.

Breitbart,"After Chinese Vaccine Fails, China Launches Smear Campaign Against Pfizer","A few days after attempting to dismiss disappointing test results from Brazil on China’s Sinovac vaccine candidate for the Chinese coronavirus, Chinese state media turned to attacking Sinovac’s American competitors Pfizer and Moderna, calling for a worldwide ban on Pfizer’s vaccine after 23 elderly Norwegians died, ostensibly from reactions to the Pfizer shots. China’s state-runGlobal Timeson Friday cited “Chinese health experts” who called for a halt to the use of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines like Pfizer’s, due to “safety uncertainties” and evidence their “efficacy was not as good as expected.” “Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist from Wuhan University, told theGlobal Timeson Friday that the death incident, if proven to be caused by the vaccines, showed that the effect of the Pfizer vaccine and other mRNA vaccines is not as good as expected, as the main purpose of mRNA vaccines is to heal patients,” the article related. Yang said China’s vaccines, by contrast, use “more mature technology.” TheGlobal Timesalso quoted an anonymous “Beijing-based immunologist” who said “the world should suspend the use of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine represented by Pfizer, as this new technology has not proven safety in large-scale use or in preventing any infectious diseases.” Midway through its breathless screed against Pfizer, theGlobal Timesadmitted that all of the 23 deaths reported in Norway occurred among “frail, elderly patients in nursing homes,” all of them more than 80 years old and some over 90. Norway’s vaccination program put an emphasis on offering vaccines to the elderly first, on the grounds that they are the cohort most at risk of severe or fatal complications from the Wuhan coronavirus. Norwegian health officials said only 13 of the deaths have been assessed so far, and “common side effects may have contributed to a severe course in frail, elderly people.” Even theGlobal Times’anonymous Beijing immunologist recommended that people over 80 should exercise caution when usinganycoronavirus medication, which rather deflates the talking point that mRNA vaccines are uniquely dangerous. “For those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant,”Bloomberg Newsquoted from a Norwegian Institute of Public Health statement. Pfizer issued a statement that said Norway’s health regulator concluded “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations.” “Allergic reactions have been uncommon so far. In the U.S., authorities reported 21 cases of severe allergic reactions from Dec. 14-23 after administration of about 1.9 million initial doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. That’s an incidence of 11.1 cases per million doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” Bloomberg News reported. “We are not alarmed by this. It is quite clear that these vaccines have very little risk, with a small exception for the frailest patients,” medical director Steinar Madsen of the Norwegian Medicine Agencies said, as quoted by theNew York Post. AnotherGlobal Timeseditorialgave away the game that China is smarting from revelations that its vaccines are much less effective than competing products: Norway is a small Northern European country and only about 25,000 people have been vaccinated with Pfizer vaccines. Twenty-three deaths are a large number. But surprisingly, mainstream English-language media did not report the incident immediately, as if they had already reached a consensus. Major US and UK media were obviously downplaying their deaths. In contrast, those major Western media will immediately hype any unfavorable information about Chinese vaccines and try to amplify their impact on public psychology. For example, the data of China’s Sinovac vaccine was lower than expected in Brazil, and it was reported everywhere in Western media. The death of a Brazilian volunteer who participated in the trials also became a major event in Western media. But it was later proven that the death had nothing to do with the vaccination, and Western media lost their interest. The COVID-19 vaccine is serious scientific issue. The current pandemic situation is extremely critical. It is the fundamental interests of all mankind to have more vaccines to fight COVID-19. However, some mainstream US and British media are taking the lead in putting geopolitical labels on vaccines. They are meddling in political stances with the scientific attitude toward vaccines, using their propaganda to promote Pfizer vaccines and smearing Chinese vaccines. “If there needs to be some comparison, then China’s inactivated vaccine definitely has more solid foundation in safety than Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine. The inactivated vaccine technology has been very mature and has undergone decades of clinical testing,” theGlobal Timesasserted, hammering the “mature technology” talking point. Working itself into a paroxysm of incoherent rage, theGlobal Timesgranted that “mass vaccination of Pfizer is a must” and “even if there are risks, these countries would rather bear them,” but then resumed slamming Western media for supposedly turning a “blind eye” to the risks and imposing “crude double standards on vaccines.” The point the Chinese editorialists are trying to make is that America and Europe had such poor responses to the coronavirus, compared to brilliantly-managed and perfectly organized China, that it is unsurprising they would roll the dice on risky vaccines in a last-ditch effort to keep the body count down. “Regrettably, Washington has promoted China-U.S. confrontation and the U.S. and its major allies have initiated their ideological frenzy. Is there any justice? They believe it is right to suppress China and wrong to be fair to China. Such an attitude has extended to serious scientific and humanitarian fields which should have been far away from politics,” theGlobal Timesrailed.",0,
BBC News,Is the US economic recovery stuck in a rut?,"The US economic recovery is now seven years old. So why don't many Americans feel like they've recovered? On paper, all the indicators are there. The current economic expansion, which began after the global financial crisis of 2008, is among the longest in modern US history. Statistics show the jobs market is improving and the unemployment rate has fallen. Some 14 million new jobs have been created in the private sector since 2010. Manufacturing alone has added 900,000 jobs. And car sales hit a record high in 2015. Janet Yellenhas said,external""the economy has made further progress"" yet despite her reassuring words, all the supposedly encouraging data, the question vexing economists is why the country isn't in better shape. You don't have to look far to see signs of the economy's fragility. Take the housing market. Eleven million Americans spent half their income on rent in 2014 -  a record high,according to the annual State of the Nation's Housing Report,externalfrom the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. The general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't spend more than 30% of your income but with rents rising faster than wages that's impossible for many. Or what about the gross domestic product (GDP), which takes into account everything we spend our money on? The US's GDP grew just 1.1% from January to March. Even the improving unemployment rate doesn't tell the whole picture. The country's labour participation rate - the share of the workforce in employment or looking for a job - is woefully low. Currently it stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s. The bottom line is that the recovery is more fragile than anyone would like. Ms Yellen has indicated that the Fed will increase interest rates slowly. ""There are structural problems in the economy and the decline in labour force participation that worries me, as well as a feeling that Washington doesn't work,"" said Glenn Hubbard, who was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W Bush and is now the dean of Columbia University business school. Mr Hubbard isn't surprised by the malaise many are expressing but argues that the root cause extends beyond the financial crisis. ""The economy as a whole is much better off from trade agreements and from immigration,"" he says, ""but there are individuals in particular who may not be. And we as an economy haven't pursued policies particularly related to supporting work to help those individuals. ""I think that's the pain we're seeing."" Income inequality between countries has gone down as a result of globalisation, but it has gone up within countries. So while workers in some parts of the world now have more opportunities, Americans have lost jobs or seen their earning power decrease. In fact, working families haven't seen a raise in decades. Many are living pay cheque to pay cheque. According to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve, nearly half of all American adultscouldn't scrape together $400 to cover a financial emergency,externalsuch as a health problem or a car that needed fixing. Part of the problem is the ""winner takes all"" economy. Those at the top are doing better. Those in the middle and bottom face stagnant wages or worse. The International Monetary Fund warned in a recent report that income inequality may become worse without intervention. The IMF is among a growing chorus sounding the alarm. ""I worry that we are in something of an inequality trap,"" says Alan Krueger, who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and is now a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. ""The fact that inequality has increased so much in the US, that the people on the bottom are starting with so many disadvantages, it's going to make it harder for them to have upward mobility. ""So I think our challenges are much greater than they were 20 years ago, 30 years ago when inequality was just starting to rise."" For a country that promises the good life to those willing to work hard, this is a troubling sign. Rising inequality threatens to impact the country's economic dynamism. The economic difficulties have led to rising resentment and anger, similar to the feelings that drove the Brexit decision in Britain. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has benefited from this growing economic populism, and one of the major themes of this upcoming presidential election is sure to be the deep-seated anger Americans feel towards the elite and globalisation. To stop the American Dream from being downsized, prosperity must be restored. The challenge for the next president is how.",2,
BBC News,"US Capitol riot committee to make criminal referrals, chairman says","The US congressional committee investigating last year's Capitol riot will make criminal referrals to the justice department, its chairman says. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, told reporters the committee had agreed to take the step but was still discussing who to refer. It is expected to meet later on Tuesday to discuss the next steps. The Democrat-led panel in the House of Representatives has been looking into the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress. Hundreds of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building on that day in a bid to thwart the certification of Joe Biden's election victory. Some 900 people have been arrested in relation to the riot, leading to hundreds of criminal charges. A total of 173 people have been sentenced for crimes including assault, entering a restricted area and destruction of government property. The House committee has previously signalled it could make criminal referrals to the justice department relating to the efforts of Mr Trump and his allies to challenge the results of the 2020 election. And while the panel does not have the power to prosecute, the justice department could - in theory - begin criminal proceedings. Speaking to reporters outside the Capitol, Mr Thompson said the panel had ""made decisions on criminal referrals"". ""I wish I could tell you one, two, three, four but that's all still being discussed,"" he said. Asked whether the committee was considering a referral for Mr Trump, he replied: ""Good try."" Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin said a subcommittee was ""bringing forward different recommendations to the full committee for consideration"". With the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives just a few weeks away following the midterm elections, the Capitol riot committee is taking care of unfinished business. From the very start, its hearings have been structured more like a criminal prosecution of Donald Trump and his associates than an open-ended public hearing. Chair Bennie Thompson, Vice-Chair Liz Cheney and the rest of the committee have presented what they view as the former president's means, motive and opportunity for the crime of trying to subvert a presidential transition of power. While that strategy up until now has been conducted for the court of public opinion rather than an actual jury, Mr Thompson has now confirmed that the committee's work will also include a recommendation for actual criminal charges. But against whom and for exactly what remains to be seen. The announcement will put renewed pressure on the justice department to pursue further criminal proceedings related to the attack - and if the target of the referral includes Mr Trump, that case could end up in the lap ofnewly named Special Counsel Jack Smith. Over the course of nine public hearings, the committee's seven Democrats and two Republicans have investigated the riot and the events that led up to it. Its members have alleged Mr Trump's public rejection of the 2020 election result prompted his supporters to storm the halls of Congress in an effort to prevent Mr Biden from being certified as the winner. Mr Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly criticised the committee and its members, characterising the inquiry as a ruse designed to distract US voters from the ""disaster"" of Democratic governance. The impending Republican takeover of the House of Representatives means the panel's work will come to an end on 3 January. In a letter to Mr Thompson, Republican Kevin McCarthy - who hopes to be the next Speaker of the House - asked last month that records be preserved and warned members of his party would seek to investigate the panel. In a separate development on Tuesday, Jack Smith -the newly appointed special counsel overseeing the justice department's investigationinto Mr Trump's alleged role in the riot - subpoenaed electoral officials in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. The requests seek any communications with Mr Trump and his team that took place between 1 June 2020 and 20 January 2021. All three states formed a key part of Mr Trump's effort to declare victory in the election. Mr Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor, is also leading the justice department's investigation into Mr Trump's potential mishandling of classified documents. His work is separate from that of the congressional committee. Ultimately, it will be Mr Smith's decision whether or not the former president - who announced his 2024 candidacy in November - will face criminal charges. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.",1,
Fox News,"Global warming skeptics as knowledgeable about science as climate change believers, study says","The predicted temperature changes (darker red indicating greater change) due to global warming, based on data that scientists, policymakers and the public are now questioning. Are global warming skeptics anti-science? Or just ignorant about science? Maybe neither. A study published Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Changefinds that people who are not that worried about the effects of global warming tend to have a slightly higher level of scientific knowledge than those who are worried, as determined by their answers to questions like: ""Electrons are smaller than atoms -- true or false?” ""How long does it take the Earth to go around the Sun? One day, one month, or one year?"" “Lasers work by focusing sound waves -- true or false?” The quiz, containing 22 questions about both science and statistics, was given to 1,540 representative Americans. Respondents who were relatively less worried about global warming got 57 percent of them right, on average, just barely outscoring those whose who saw global warming as a bigger threat. They got 56 percent of the questions correct. [pullquote] ""As respondents’ science literacy scores increased, their concern with climate change decreased,"" the paper, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, notes. Yale Law Professor Dan Kahan, the lead author of the study, cautioned that the survey results are not evidence for or against climate change. ""This study is agnostic on what people ought to believe,"" he told FoxNews.com. ""It just doesn’t follow to say this finding implies anything about what people should believe on this issue."" Kahan said that he thought another finding of the study was more important: That people’s cultural views – how much they value things like individualism and equality -- affect their views on global warming much more than actual knowledge about science. Regardless of how much they know about science, individualists were relatively unconcerned about global warming, whereas those who value equality were very concerned. Both sides of the global warming debate say the study's findings support their views. Those who worry about global warming say it shows that cultural biases blind even smart people to the “scientific consensus.” ""Kahan’s research is so interesting,” Aaron Huertas, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told FoxNews.com. “Over the last few years, the policy issues surrounding climate change have become increasingly politicized, and that’s bleeding over into people’s perceptions of climate science.” ""What we need to remember is that we have a number of excellent non-partisan scientific resources… [They] all tell us that human activity is altering the climate in ways that are disruptive to our economy and way of life."" But some of the 16 scientists who signed a letter this January titled ""No Need to Panic About Global Warming"" disagree. Dr. Richard Lindzen, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT, was one skeptical scientist who signed the letter. He said that the finding that skeptics know as much or more about science surprised him ""not at all."" ""MIT alumni are among my most receptive audiences,"" he added.",0,
BBC News,Skills shortages holding back the UK's economic recovery,"The UK's chronic skills shortage is hampering productivity and holding back the economic recovery, business leaders believe. Kevin Green, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), whose members are ""on the front line of the UK labour market"" as he puts it, paints an alarming picture. ""Last year we had nine areas of skills shortages, now we have 43 areas. Every single type of engineering is in short supply, from mechanical to software, civil to electrical,"" says Mr Green. ""In IT, coders, programmers, developers are all in short supply; there's a shortage of doctors and nurses in the National Health Service; and we need about 20,000 more teachers in the UK. ""And the situation's been getting worse month-on-month over the last 18 months,"" he adds. Employers organisation the CBI concurs. ""Our most recent survey shows that skills shortages are becoming more acute, and risk acting as a break on our economic recovery,"" says Rob Wall, the CBI's head of employment and education. ""This is particularly true for high-level skills in sectors like engineering, technology, digital, manufacturing and construction."" The consensus is that the UK is particularly lacking in workers proficient in Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. The CBI found that nearly 40% of firms looking for staff with Stem skills have had difficulties recruiting, and about half thought the situation was only going to get worse. The shortage is particularly acute in construction, encompassing as it does a wide range of disciplines from structural engineering to architecture, bricklaying to surveying. ""Quantity surveying was on a skills shortage list back in 2007,"" says Alan Muse, global director of the built environment at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). ""We never had enough in the first place. Then the recession meant people stopped investing in building, so many migrated out of construction into other sectors, using their transferable skills as experienced graduates,"" he adds. When the money taps were turned on again as the economy picked up, skills shortages became all the more evident. According toone recent report,externalby accountants KPMG and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), about 20% more construction managers, surveyors, electricians and other trades will be needed to meet demand, over the next four years, than were needed from 2010-13. House building targets are unlikely to be met as a result. ""About 400,000 people left the industry since 2008,"" says Richard Steer, chairman of Gleeds, a leading construction management company responsible for a wide range of projects, from nuclear power stations to luxury apartments. So the industry is now suffering from a severe shortage of almost all skilled people. ""Brick factories closed down [during the recession] so house builders have suffered a huge shortage of raw materials and bricklayers,"" he says. ""Brickies are flocking to the South East leaving shortages in the regions,"" he points out. Filling these gaps isn't easy, as training takes time and money. ""It takes about three or four years to become a good brickie,"" says Mr Steer. These skills shortfalls mean the price of construction goes up ""at a time when we're trying to create more social and affordable housing,"" he adds. Identifying the problem is relatively easy; coming up with solutions is far harder. In another recent report -Growth Through People,external- the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) called for: employers to take a lead in improving skill levels more vocational pathways to work more integration between the worlds of work and education more apprenticeships work experience to become an integral part of education The report, which was endorsed by the CBI and the Trades Union Congress, concluded that the skills shortage crisis would only be addressed if industry, unions, government and educators collaborated on an agreed strategy. The government has certainly been investing in traineeships and apprenticeships, but there is frustration among large employers that they have not been sufficiently involved in designing the schemes and courses. ""The system to date has been about government deciding what skills are needed rather than employers,"" says the CBI's Mr Wall. ""We want to see a system that is simpler and that puts employers in the driving seat."" Recent reforms to the apprenticeships scheme, implemented by Business Secretary Vince Cable, have been welcomed by business. But most organisations agree that more could be done to remove the stigma attached to vocational subjects in schools, colleges and universities. ""Vocational routes are seen as second class and that isn't acceptable,"" says Mr Wall. ""Germany, South Korea and Switzerland have much more successful vocational routes to employment."" Skills Minister Nick Boles is trying to do this by encouraging university-style graduation ceremonies for successful apprentices. While immigration is currently a political hot potato, with most vote-chasing political parties promising to clamp down on it, the construction industry admits - with varying degrees of candour - that it needs more, not fewer, workers from abroad. And rather than being swamped with cheap, immigrant labour, Gleeds' Mr Steer believes it is actually getting harder to attract foreign workers. ""There's less temptation for foreign skilled and unskilled labourers to come over now as their own economies have improved,"" he says. This only adds to the skills shortages experienced within the industry. His view is backed up byOxford University's Migration Observatory,external, which found that there was a 39% fall in highly skilled immigrants coming to the UK from non-European Economic Area countries between 2011 and 2013. Restricting visas for skilled immigrants is ""absurd"", says the REC's Kevin Green. ""It's bizarre that we invite people here to train them up, then don't ask them to join our labour market,"" he says. ""We've created 700,000 jobs in the last year and unemployment is falling, but employers are finding it more and more difficult to find the skills they need."" The UK's productivity paradox remains and skills shortages would appear to be a likely cause.",2,
AP News,"Massive fire at Pennsylvania aerospace plant prompts shelter-in-place order, evacuations","JENKINTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Schools were closed and residents were ordered to shelter-in-place Tuesday after a large fire broke out at an aerospace manufacturer’s facility in a town north of Philadelphia, officials said. The fire broke out at SPS Technologies in Jenkintown around 9:30 p.m. Monday. Witnesses said there was an explosion and flames could be seen inside the warehouse, the Abington Township Police Department said in a statement on social media. The building was evacuated, all employees were accounted for and no injuries were reported. SPS Technologies describes itself as a developer, manufacturer and global supplier of a line of aerospace fasteners and precision components. The Abington and Jenkintown school districts and all private and parochial schools were closed Tuesday and will remain shuttered on Wednesday. The shelter-in-place order initially was in effect until the incident was under control because smoke and particulates from the fire were filtering across the area, officials said. But residents and businesses in the immediate area near the plant — roughly 700 people — were asked to voluntarily evacuate late Tuesday afternoon “while conditions permit” because of concerns over air quality. Hazmat crews were monitoring air quality and advised all businesses within a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) radius to remain closed until further notice. Service on three Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority regional rail lines remained suspended late Tuesday afternoon because of the fire.",2,

He added: ‘Now, if we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting, they just can’t have it.’ Trump has railed against mail-in balloting for months, and at a White House briefing Wednesday, he [said] that USPS’s enlarged role in the November election would perpetuate ‘one of the greatest frauds in history.’”Trump tells Barr and prosecutor to bring Biden down quickly -TPM: “President Trump on Thursday issued an ultimatum to Attorney GeneralBill Barrover the months-long probe led by U.S. AttorneyJohn Durham, whom Barr tapped last year to investigate the origins of the Russia probe. When pressed during a Fox Business Network interview on Thursday morning on his thoughts regarding the Durham probe, Trump replied that he hopes Durham’s team will do a ‘great job’ and that his team ‘is not going to be politically correct.’ … ‘Bill Barr can go down as the greatest attorney general in the history of our country, or he can go down as an average guy,’ Trump said, regarding the Durham probe. ‘We’ll see what happens.’ The President added that Barr is ‘great most of the time’ but that ‘he’ll be just another guy’ if he ‘wants to be politically correct.’ ‘(Barr and Durham) have all the answers,’ Trump said. ‘It goes all to Obama, and it goes right to Biden.’”Johnson admits pressure to use committee to harm Biden -Fox News: “Senate Homeland Security Committee ChairmanRon Johnsonsaid subpoenas are ‘forthcoming’ in his panel’s investigation into the origins of the Russia probe … ‘The clock is ticking, I understand folks on our side see what Democrats have done, but I am not a Democrat.

And I hope our base wouldn’t want us to do the exact same thing – when you see what Democrats have done, with Special CounselRobert Muellerand the impeachment.’ … Johnson, during an interview with [pro-Trump radio host]Hugh Hewittthis week, referenced some initial hesitation from Republican committee members earlier this summer, prior to giving him authority to issue subpoenas.

The guidance from the agency came in an advisory opinion issued in response to a request from CongresswomanCarolyn Maloneyof New York, the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, concerning the Hatch Act, a federal law that governs the political activity of executive branch employees. The Office of Special Counsel is an independent agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act and other laws concerning federal employees. ‘The president and the vice president are not covered by any provisions of the Hatch Act,’Erica Hamrick, deputy chief of the office's Hatch Act Unit, told Maloney in a letter Wednesday. ‘Accordingly, the Hatch Act does not prohibit President Trump from delivering his RNC acceptance speech on White House grounds.’”THE RULEBOOK: SEE WILSON, WOODROW“It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority.” –Alexander Hamilton,Federalist No. 8TIME OUT: SALUD AL PARRILLEROPrior to the pandemic, food writerPati Jinichtraveled to Mexico to get the backstory on a new American favorite.NYT: “At a taco stand anywhere else, carne asada is grilled meat. But in Sonora, a carne asada is the weekly gathering of friends and family, with the dish at its heart. Every component — from the dishes (the meat, the salsa, the beans, the smashed guacamole never with lime, the pillowy-soft flour tortillas) to their preparation (the cooking, the taco assembly) to everyone’s role (the parrillero, or grill master, his family members, the guests) — is treated with almost reverence. A shared culinary experience, it embodies Sonora’s agricultural way of life, bringing together the pillars of its economy: its beef, from the cattle that roam the region’s ranches, and its flour tortillas, from the wheat that blankets its fields. I learned that, to understand a carne asada, you needed to be invited to one. And that doesn’t just happen.

The presumptive Democratic nominee and former vice president announced on Wednesday that his campaign's raised a staggering $26 million since Tuesday's running mate announcement. At a virtual grassroots fundraiser with Harris, Biden said that in the past 24 hours ‘we raised $26 million.’ And he noted that 150,000 of the donors were first time contributors to his presidential campaign. ‘It's really palpable, the excitement,’ Biden emphasized. The previous record for a single Biden fundraising event appears to be $11 million, which was the amount brought in by the former vice president when he teamed up with his one-time boss, former PresidentBarack Obama, at a combined grassroots and top-dollar donor fundraiser in late June.”Harris’ Senate record reflects perfect partisanship -Roll Call: “Kamala Harris’s arrival in the Senate coincided with the start of the Trump administration in 2017, and the Democratic vice presidential candidate’s legislative record shows her to be a reliable soldier of the opposition party. Because of that reality, there’s been limited opportunity for crossover voting for Joe Biden’s choice of running mate, but that doesn’t mean there’s been none. Her party unity score, calculated by CQ Roll Call as the percentage of votes cast in which a lawmaker votes the same way as a majority of the members of their caucus, is north of 99 percent. Notable times that she has dissented with the party include her 2019 vote against a Middle East security package that warned against ‘precipitous withdrawal’ of U.S. military forces in Syria and Afghanistan. She was one of 22 Democratic caucus members to cast a no vote.”John Harris: Biden’s brand is bland -Politico: “Since JFK inaugurated the television era of politics in 1960, successful presidential candidates have been theatrical candidates. The exceptions, likeGerald FordorGeorge H.W. Bush, had short tenures that tended to prove the rule. Winning politicians have had narrative electricity – they were performers and storytellers who could command the attention of people who loathed them no less than those who revered them. Biden promises an end to that era. The narrative drama in his performances comes largely from the possibility that he will step on his own words and create a self-damaging storyline. After marinating for 36 years in the U.S. Senate, the best that can be said about his political persona is that it is bland. What is now clear is that his claim on the presidency comes not despite blandness but in essential ways because of it.”SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER: LAST HOPES FOR VIRUS DEAL FADEAP: “Americans counting on emergency coronavirus aid from Washington may have to wait until fall. Negotiations over a new virus relief package have all but ended, with the White House and congressional leaders far apart on the size, scope and approach for shoring up households, re-opening schools and launching a national strategy to contain the virus. PresidentDonald Trump’s top negotiator, Treasury SecretarySteven Mnuchin, tried to revive stalled talks Wednesday, but House SpeakerNancy Pelosiand Senate Democratic leaderChuck Schumerdismissed the ‘overture,’ saying the Trump administration is still refusing to meet them halfway. Congressional Republicans are largely sitting out the talks. ‘The White House is not budging,’ Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. With the House and Senate essentially closed, and lawmakers on call to return with 24-hours notice, hopes for a swift compromise have dwindled. Instead, the politics of blame have taken hold, as the parties head into August focused on the presidential nominating conventions and lawmakers’ own reelection campaigns.”Layoffs dip below one million -WSJ: “U.S. unemployment claims fell to less than one million last week for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in March, a sign the labor-market recovery is regaining steam. New applications for unemployment benefits dropped to seasonally adjusted 963,000 in the week ended Aug. 8, the Labor Department said Thursday. … The decline in jobless claims indicates layoffs are easing and hiring is picking up, saidJulia Pollak, economist at job site ZipRecruiter. ‘There may now just finally be enough activity to make businesses feel confident enough to try to open their doors even though they’re running at a low capacity in most cases,’ she said. The drop in claims could also reflect waning fiscal support, Ms. Pollak said. The expiration of the extra $600 a week in benefits puts much less money in unemployed individuals’ pockets, possibly discouraging them from applying for benefits.”Voters give U.S., Trump failing marks on virus response -Monmouth University: “President Donald Trump continues to receive poor marks for his response to the coronavirus outbreak, as a majority of the American public believes the U.S. is handling the pandemic worse than other countries. … Most Americans (52%) think the United States’ handling of the pandemic is worse than other countries. … Less than 4 in 10 (38%) Americans express confidence that the country will be able to limit the impact of the outbreak over the next few weeks. … Public opinion of Trump’s handling of the pandemic remains negative. Currently, 40% say he is doing a good job and 57% say he is doing a bad job. This rating stood at 40% good job and 54% bad job in late June.”The Judge’s Ruling: Courts should stop Trump from spending without Congress-This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst JudgeAndrew Napolitanoexplains why the Treasury cannot legally borrow or spend a nickel unless it has been expressly authorized to do so by law: “Borrowing and giving away money will just postpone the day of reckoning. … But don’t hold your breath for these free-market solutions to happen. It would mean a loss of control for the government. …[The] Treasury cannot legally borrow or spend a nickel unless it has been expressly authorized to do so by law — meaning by legislation enacted by Congress. This is neither a novel nor a political observation. It is Constitutional Law 101. Thus, when the president — no matter his goals — attempts to exercise power that the Constitution has given exclusively to Congress, it is the duty of the courts to stop him.” Morehere.KEVIN MCCARTHY GETS BLAME FOR GEORGIA DEBACLEPolitico: “Marjorie Taylor Greenevowed to be the left’s ‘worst nightmare’ after she won the GOP nomination for a conservative district in Georgia on Tuesday night. But House Republican LeaderKevin McCarthyis the one who is most likely to be haunted by Greene. The rise of Greene — an unapologetic QAnon conspiracy theorist who has made disparaging remarks about Jews, Blacks, and Muslims — is threatening to hurt the entire party as Republicans seek to stanch their bleeding in suburbia and expand their base of support amid a national reckoning over racial inequality. Greene won a GOP primary runoff in a deep red northwest Georgia seat, all but guaranteeing her a spot in Congress next year. Now Republicans up and down the ballot will have to answer for Greene’s controversial remarks. And she’s showing no signs of softening her rhetoric. … By Wednesday, Greene was already in a Twitter war with a sitting House Republican who said there is ‘no place in Congress for these conspiracies.’ A Trump campaign spokesman then jumped to Greene's defense.”PLAY-BY-PLAYPergram: The rooms where it happens (or doesn’t)-Fox NewsWill Trump fire Esper or will the Pentagon boss quit first?-BloombergAUDIBLE: SOUNDS SUPER SAFE""Just as the SEALs surmounted obstacles to bringOsama bin Ladento justice, so too would the Martin County School system find a way to provide parents with a meaningful choice of in-person instruction or continued distance learning.” –Florida Gov.Ron DeSantisat an event promoting in-person classes.FROM THE BLEACHERS“Chris, I have been a big fan of yours for a long time. I love to hear you reminisce about food. One of the comments that has stuck in my mind is that you didn’t like the show West Wing. Can you explain why? Is there anything about the show that you did like? Finally, has there ever been a show about politics that you found acceptable in any way. Thank you, keep up the good work!” –Dawson Miller, Jasper, Ind.[Ed. note: It’s not just the “West Wing” I can’t bear. It’s most ofAaron Sorkin’s preachy, contrived, sanctimonious television writing that plays out in stilted expository dialogue. His show “The Newsroom” must be the most overrated television product in decades. I have more than a passing knowledge about the world of cable news and can assure you the show bears little relationship to reality. Sorkin’sJeremiahin that one is a pompous newscaster who suddenly decides to “tell it like it is.” As if what was lacking in the world of journalism today were enough gasbags who were ready to tell viewers and readers how to think and what to do. Some of Sorkin’s movies, including “The American President,” which was the basis for “The West Wing,” “Moneyball” and “A Few Good Men” have been better than his TV work. (Though try to imagine the self-righteous tomb “A Few Good Men” would have been ifJack Nicholsonhad not stolen the show.) I genuinely love “Charlie Wilson’s War.” And while Sorkin is certainly preaching in that one, he allows some complexity that makes the movie more satisfying than his efforts at being a liberal version ofFrank Capra. Also,Alec Baldwin’s over-the-top villain in Sorkin’s “Malice” is one of my favorites of Baldwin’s portrayals. As far as good political TV, I did enjoy the first couple of seasons of “House of Cards,” which allowed itself to revel in its absurdity. The original British version of the show is excellent, as well.  But “Veep” has to be my favorite recent purely political show. It can be howlingly funny, but it never fails to reinforce an important message: We’ve got a real competency problem in politics and government these days.Julia Louis-Dreyfusis just the best. Others worth a look, in no particular order: “Yes, Minister,” “The Americans” and “Spin City.” And what I consider to be the show that best captured the intersection of politics, media and government: “The Wire.”]Share your color commentary:Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COMand please make sure to include your name and hometown.100 GALLONS OF WISHESUPI: “An aquarium in North Carolina said it drained a wishing waterfall to cash in on 14 years of tossed coins -- about 100 gallons' worth.

But on the matter of requesting special counsel status, Jordan said Weiss had requested it prior to being appointed in August. ""When he was specifically asked, ‘Did you ever request special attorney authority under Section 515, Mr. Weiss?’ His response was, ‘Yes, in the spring of 2022,’"" Jordan said after Weiss' interview. ""So, that goes to the heart of the matter. He requested it, was not given that request – never had that authority throughout the time. And yet he pretends that somehow he did have that."" Jordan said Weiss would not answer ""a lot of questions"" but that the ""key takeaway"" was about ""the changing story we got from DOJ regarding the authority"" that Weiss had. Jordan said Weiss' testimony was ""entirely consistent"" with what IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley said. Shapley alleged that in October 2022 Weiss said he requested special counsel authority but the ""DOJ denied his request and told him to follow the process."" ""So, once again, Shapley and Ziegler's testimony continues to stand up to every single witness we brought in,"" Jordan said. IRS whistleblowersShapley and Joseph Ziegleralleged that politics affected prosecutorial decisions throughout the probe with regard to search warrants, decisions about lines of questioning during interviews of specific people, and more. Shapley also alleged that Weiss did not have ""ultimate authority"" to pursue charges against the president's son and instead needed approval from the Justice Department – something that DOJ officials confirmed in their voluntary transcribed interviews before the committee.

Fox News Digital reviewed a copy of the transcript of Goldberg's interview in which he said Weiss needed approval from his unit at the Justice Department before bringing charges in the Hunter Biden probe. Goldberg also said that a prosecutor could appeal his division's decision if they disagreed. Shapley further alleged that Weiss was considering bringing charges against Hunter Biden in California but the U.S. attorney there chose not to partner with him for prosecution. The charges were never filed. Martin Estrada, the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, told the House Judiciary Committee during his transcribed interview last month that he did, in fact, decline to partner with Weiss in bringing charges against Hunter Biden in his district. Estrada, though, did offer Weiss ""administrative support."" IRS OFFICIAL SAYS HE WAS FRUSTRATED DOJ DID NOT BRING CHARGES AGAINST HUNTER BIDEN FOR 2014, 2015 TAX YEARS In his first move as special counsel, Weiss charged Biden with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federal firearms licensed dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.

BBC News,Harrogate College: Approval for Â£22m green technology hub,"Plans to demolish the main building of a college and build a Â£22m hub to train students in green technology have been approved. Harrogate College said the new facilities at Hornbeam Park would become a ""centre of renewable and sustainable excellence"". Proposals include a mock hospital ward, a digital technology suite and an electric vehicle workshop. Work on the project is due to be completed by July 2025. Planning documents considered by North Yorkshire Council ahead of granting approval stated the main office block, built in the 1980s, had fallen into disrepair. The replacement will be smaller than the existing building and would make ""education more efficient and streamlined for students"". The plans received 28 objections over the reduction in car parking spaces, though the college said there was an overprovision of parking at the current car park of 48%. Harrogate College, part of the Luminate Education Group, caters to full and part-time students and offers adult education and apprenticeships. Principal Danny Wild told theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicethe plan's approval on 24 April was ""great news for the college, town and North Yorkshire"". ""[It] will enable us to upgrade our campus to enhance our industry-standard training facilities... and help us provide even more targeted support for local employers by tailoring our training to produce the skilled workers they need."" He said the college would work to keep disruption to a minimum during construction. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,X (formerly Twitter),externalandInstagram,external.
